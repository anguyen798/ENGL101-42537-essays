1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:01,280
I have no apologies

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:03,328
I was

3
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:04,864
A crusader

4
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:05,888
For the development of water

5
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:09,216
I was the Messiah I was the evangelist

6
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:11,776
And went out

7
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,568
And argued persuasively

8
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,384
To develop our rivers

9
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:23,552
And water supplies for the benefit of people

10
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:51,200
In the American Desert

11
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:54,272
We have built a great new civilization

12
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:56,064
In less than a century

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,624
Where none could possibly be

14
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:00,672
In the natural order of things

15
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,424
We have made the land wet where it was dry

16
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,704
And dry

17
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,728
Where it was wet

18
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:20,128
We have lifted great rivers

19
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:26,528
Out of their ancient beds and moved them over half a continent

20
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:32,928
Our great cities stand in a desert that is drier than the

21
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:39,328
plains Of North Africa

22
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:45,728
It would all be impossible without the breathtaking manipulation of water

23
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:52,128
We fought over water thrived on water

24
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,920
And finally

25
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:56,736
We engineered the desert out of existence

26
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,064
Next to God there's water

27
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,368
Everybody is

28
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,136
Conscious of water

29
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:06,976
If you headed for the river with a empty bucket you'll likely ever get shot

30
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,048
Can you imagine today

31
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,328
An American city

32
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,608
Acquiring

33
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,912
An entire river

34
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,936
The idea of

35
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,472
Subduing nature

36
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,240
has captivated

37
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,008
the whole

38
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:19,776
country

39
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:24,640
Congress cannot appropriate enough money fast enough to build more dams

40
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:37,440
We built the dams for all the right reasons

41
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,488
When they were desperately needed with little thought to the consequences

42
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:52,800
The developing world watched and envied our success

43
00:02:59,456 --> 00:02:59,968
The engineering marvel that is Hoover Dam inspected by emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia

44
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:05,344
Supplying water to the population growing that fast is extremely difficult

45
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,160
It was a little bit like the sorcerer's apprentice

46
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:13,024
You gotta have more water more water more water they're going to

47
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,792
Dam this

48
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,560
Canyon

49
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:17,888
There was no end to these people who had plans to

50
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:24,288
dam San Francisco Bay pipelines beyond your wildest dreams when this wasn't about carrying oil

51
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,080
this was about carrying water

52
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:29,408
We have forgotten that the natural west

53
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,712
is barren

54
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:35,808
and fatally dry and that our new bountiful west

55
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:42,208
Is a fragile Construction

56
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:48,608
Here and there are reminders of what happens when the water is turned off

57
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:56,544
But when the Water Works fail somehow if the water stops flowing

58
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:02,944
You'll have a desert again overnight

59
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,759
Well at 6:22 and 7:10

60
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:42,111
If you see I'm Dominic with AirWatch traffic and I got to tell you the jackknife big Rick

61
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:46,975
Pasadena has the 210 Eastbound in trouble right at Rosemead where the right three lanes are out of commission

62
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,255
The Jack and I figured there

63
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,535
What about a quarter mile slow

64
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,815
On the westbound side almost

65
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,839
Across the fence from

66
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:52,863
Right at Sierra Madre

67
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:59,263
And how are things in Orange County

68
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,015
How do you say

69
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:15,135
Component Street

70
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,159
Trying to protected by

71
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:16,927
Vehic

72
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,207
Use alternate routes such

73
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,999
Is Laurel Canyon or even Mulholland

74
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:20,767
Today

75
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:32,799
I think my grandfather his Vision was a city like Dublin

76
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,335
Which was the

77
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:37,663
City of his childhood and it was

78
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,967
A vision I think of a 19th century city

79
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,783
Where people

80
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,319
Ambled

81
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:47,903
Streets and you they knew one another and

82
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,695
Enjoyed

83
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,999
The theater and the Opera

84
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,559
And the University

85
00:05:54,815 --> 00:06:00,959
A civilized 19th Century City

86
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:04,799
No other Buick dealership in California has been best in its class

87
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,079
For 7 years

88
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:09,663
That's because no other Buick dealership is sold more than 10,000 Buick

89
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,223
In the last 10 years the list goes on and on

90
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,039
Right when you have lots of traffic to talk about too

91
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,063
First of all

92
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:22,207
The thing that you you have to remember about Los Angeles

93
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,511
Never really had a reason

94
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,535
To be there

95
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:29,119
It had no minerals no Metals no forest

96
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,143
In other words

97
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,935
Everything that

98
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,215
Major

99
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:36,799
To develop

100
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,567
Itself

101
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,335
LA

102
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,103
lacked

103
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,919
And above all it like

104
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:49,087
Since the beginning of time this was a place of earthquakes

105
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,623
And Perpetual drought

106
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,951
First Claim by the span

107
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,511
And then conquered by the Americans

108
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,327
Virtually everyone here

109
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,863
I come from somewhere else

110
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,935
In 1878

111
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:07,263
William o'hallan arrived from the Green Hills of Ireland

112
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,823
It stood away in a sailing ship

113
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,615
Worked at the lumberjack

114
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:16,991
Failed as a gold miner and had walked across Panama to save $25 in train far

115
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,319
He was fond of one armed chin ups and grand opera

116
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:26,207
Mulholland found work as a ditch digger on the growing towns dilapidated

117
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:31,583
Hell I was desperate to become a modern city it had been

118
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,143
Backwater for so many decades

119
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,751
Pretty much the same old Jerry Built thing

120
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,543
Bunch of old water wheel

121
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,591
A falling apart system

122
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,151
He worked hard

123
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:51,551
Read Shakespeare and Hydraulic Engineering laid into the night entire la

124
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,111
And climb through the ranks

125
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:58,463
In 1886 when his boss suddenly dropped dead

126
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,767
Will get more Holland found himself superintendent of the LA Water system

127
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,447
The little desert Pueblo had grown to 100,000 people

128
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,031
Thanks to the Chamber of Commerce and a new Railroad

129
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:16,127
And by 1903

130
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:21,247
La had sucked dry the tiny Los Angeles River it's only source of water

131
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,111
My mother would tell me these stories

132
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,391
Of growing up without

133
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,183
One bath

134
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:35,071
A week on Saturday night and I washed and a big zinc tub that was dragged into the kitchen

135
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,607
And water heated

136
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,887
And papa got the first

137
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,167
Your spell mama

138
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:43,007
And the kids and mother told me you know and they were not

139
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,543
What you call

140
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:48,127
She told me she never had a bath

141
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,407
in pure clean

142
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,175
Water

143
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:54,527
I was raised with a real sense that water

144
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,807
The precious item

145
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,087
And not

146
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,111
Squand

147
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:03,743
Superintendent Mulholland tried to make Los Angeles live within its means

148
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,815
Sabotaged everything he did

149
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,887
By 1903

150
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,935
The chief knew that La would have

151
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:12,959
Stop growing

152
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:15,519
Or he would have to find a new source of water

153
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,359
His friend

154
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:23,967
Mayor Fred Eaton told him of a Great Valley 200 miles to the north

155
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,623
For centuries Paiutes had lived along the Owens River

156
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,463
White settlers who colonized Owens Valley

157
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:40,607
Found Paiutes irrigating natural grasses with several miles of small irrigation canals

158
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:47,007
My grandmother told my oldest sister that when the lights came they started

159
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,311
To push the Indians up into the

160
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,591
Rocky

161
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,639
Places where the water

162
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,407
was scarce

163
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,711
Because they wanted the water

164
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,015
For for their cattle

165
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,039
And

166
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,855
And they came in and they fenced everything up

167
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,879
What's everything

168
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:10,047
They started saying if you want use my water you have to have special permission and Indians always like the water run

169
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,839
It was never

170
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:17,215
It's something that belonged to one individual person it belong to the whole community

171
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,823
By 1904

172
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,615
Settlers from New England

173
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:26,943
Switzerland and Scotland had taken the Indians land

174
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:32,319
Established farms in a dozen towns and a steamboat service on the age-old Owens Lake

175
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:43,327
They dug an elaborate irrigation system diverting the Owens River into

176
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,863
Hundreds of miles of ditches

177
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:51,519
Former mayor Fred Eaton convince Mulholland to set out Northwood across the

178
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:55,615
Mojave Desert in the fall of 1904 toward Owens Valley

179
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,919
They went by buckboard

180
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,735
Which was the only way you could go it took them about 2 weeks to get there

181
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,831
I think there was a trail of whiskey bottles all the way out

182
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,903
In 2 weeks

183
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,231
Mulholland and Eaton were on the banks of the Owens River

184
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,887
At certain times of year in wet years anyway

185
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:21,471
You can get a little glimpse of what

186
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,775
The river must have been like then

187
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,847
And how it must have impressed Mulholland

188
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:35,807
The Owens

189
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,855
Valley is one of the most dramatic places in the world

190
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:44,255
You have on the one side

191
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,279
The Sierra Nevada

192
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,863
Virtually every Mountain over 14,000 ft

193
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,655
And then you have

194
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,191
A drop of

195
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,727
two miles

196
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:54,751
To the valley

197
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,519
Floor

198
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,543
And then a rise of

199
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,591
almost 2 miles up

200
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:02,943
To the white mountain range because

201
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,967
The mountains

202
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,015
Stop virtually all weather there is no rain in Owen's Valley

203
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,551
It is in the

204
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,879
And there's no rain in the Owens Valley it is

205
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,903
True desert

206
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,927
Looking

207
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,695
On

208
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,487
Snow cover

209
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,303
And through the middle of it comes

210
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,607
What you almost could call it

211
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,887
Mississippi River

212
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:22,655
Setting

213
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,447
It is so improbable

214
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:26,751
Desert

215
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,287
To see a river

216
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,311
That used

217
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,847
As in

218
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,479
And

219
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,271
Not only was this a river

220
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,551
That

221
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:40,831
Take care of

222
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,111
The

223
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,415
He probably

224
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,439
50

225
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,463
Population

226
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,487
La

227
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,767
But

228
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,303
Flow all the way

229
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,327
By

230
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,911
Funny

231
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,191
First time

232
00:12:56,447 --> 00:13:02,335
And back so full of enthusiasm he says you know I've seen something here as water that'll

233
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,615
Into the next

234
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,199
And I think about Holland suddenly

235
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,991
Must have changed

236
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,527
And he saw himself

237
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,063
As a sort of

238
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,623
Builder of a Roman Masterwork

239
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,415
Is somebody who

240
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,439
Kept

241
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,719
Great hydraulic

242
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,511
Engineering

243
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,535
Traditional

244
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:25,119
I can't tell you what went through his head but suddenly he was a convert

245
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,655
Having been more of

246
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:30,239
An efficiency guy at a conservationist suddenly he became

247
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,519
Empire builder

248
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,799
Almost overnight

249
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:42,015
They were going to capture a river the only river that kind of accidentally flow

250
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:46,111
To this desert and they were going to move the whole river

251
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,391
Across

252
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,695
200 plus miles of terrain

253
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,791
Cover that some risk probably to their

254
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,887
The problem facing Mulholland

255
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,167
Was that the river was

256
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,471
Was old all the water

257
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,751
We're owned by Farm

258
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,823
So irrigating something like 60,000 Acres

259
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:06,847
This was

260
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,895
Driving agricultural area

261
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,943
Time and it was being further developed

262
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,967
By the beer Rec

263
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:20,415
The how in the world were you going to rest that water away from these farmers

264
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,695
And the federal government

265
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:22,975
That was

266
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,023
Can you imagine today

267
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,303
American city

268
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,839
Acquiring

269
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,887
An entire River

270
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,655
For its

271
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,191
Course

272
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,263
It goes without saying it couldn't be done but it was done then

273
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,431
Posing his agents for a federal project meant to irrigate Owens Valley

274
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,991
Mulholland's men went to the county courthouse

275
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:50,367
There they convinced clerks to show them Deeds

276
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,927
Maps and records of streamflows

277
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,279
Within days

278
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:00,351
Eden was quietly buying property and water

279
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,127
Not to a local irrigation project

280
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,175
But to the city of Los Angeles

281
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,783
Without telling Mulholland

282
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:23,903
Former mayor Fred Eaton bought the only damn side of Owens Valley for himself

283
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,719
City New

284
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
Who

285
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,511
The best water

286
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,815
Who was likeliest Sal

287
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,351
It was

288
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,911
Didn't take very long

289
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,959
For them to capture most of that River

290
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,519
Two people who would

291
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,287
Ultimately benefit

292
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,079
And who knew the whole story of

293
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:45,407
Where the Publishers of the Los Angeles Times

294
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,455
Harrison gray Otis and Harry Chandler

295
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,503
They were the big

296
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,831
Promoters and boosters but they were sworn to secre

297
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,903
As this was going on they did not let the cat out of the bag

298
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,183
Until they couldn't help

299
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,999
And finally under a bed

300
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,023
The Titan

301
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,815
Project to give the city a river

302
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:05,119
They talked about how the whole thing had gone

303
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,143
And

304
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,239
You know what I mean when you read that today and imagine a major city newspaper

305
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,287
Just kind of gloating over the trium

306
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,567
Of

307
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,359
You know it's

308
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,639
Artifice

309
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,711
It

310
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,735
You're

311
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,015
In a sense but that was

312
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,807
What Los Angeles was liking

313
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,599
It was

314
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,135
The climate was one of

315
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,415
Of

316
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,463
Getting what you want

317
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,487
Anyway

318
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,863
The Owens Valley Paper saw the future differently

319
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,983
The still secret Aqueduct route

320
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:45,823
Would pass through the San Fernando Valley on its way to LA

321
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:50,431
And someone was buying up near worthless land in the San Fernando

322
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,063
Now

323
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,855
Another cat out of the bag

324
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:04,767
It was a real estate Syndicate that would make millions of Owens River water irrigated their newly acquired San

325
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,791
Fernando Valley land

326
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,607
What was happening

327
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,655
All the while these water

328
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,935
The Owens Valley

329
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,239
Requirement was at the San Fernando Valley

330
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,263
You being

331
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,543
Stop by a cynical

332
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,823
Who represented

333
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,127
Power structure of Los Angeles

334
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,407
What kind of exquisite

335
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,943
Sense of proportion

336
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,551
Incest

337
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:33,439
If Jonathan Club California

338
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,975
Oh boy

339
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,767
Wasp Network

340
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,351
Dogs black

341
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:46,239
Mexicans alive

342
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,263
Was bought

343
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,031
By

344
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,567
First capitalists of Los Angeles

345
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,591
For the purpose

346
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,383
Of irrigating it

347
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,175
But it Owens River finally arrived

348
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:57,503
Because Los Angeles wouldn't need all that water for a long time

349
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,783
If water could be brought

350
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,807
The San Fernando

351
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,343
From the Owens Valley

352
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,903
That rangy grassland

353
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:07,231
Send me arid terrain could be turned into

354
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:07,999
Absol

355
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,655
With all the cats out of all the bag

356
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:17,215
Listens with now vote on the

357
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,591
Mulholland campaign with a vengeance

358
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:30,271
Secretly

359
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,623
But in the middle of a drought

360
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:37,695
With the temperature climbing toward 105

361
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:44,095
The people of La voted 10 to 1 to pay for mulholland's aqueduct to bring them the river they

362
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:54,591
I think one thing that gets overlooked when does in discussing the

363
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,151
That it was

364
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,943
A popular

365
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,223
Move

366
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,759
From the president of the United

367
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,063
States down to the voters

368
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,367
In the city of Los Angeles

369
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,927
Highly approved

370
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:09,951
Project

371
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:16,351
President Theodore Roosevelt deciding the greatest good for the greatest number

372
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:19,679
Made Owens Valley off limits to further development

373
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:22,239
By surrounding it with a national forest

374
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:27,359
It's only became part of the Indio National Forest the only National Forest in America would hardly any trees

375
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:31,967
The only trees were the orchard trees that were being irrigated and were about to die

376
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:36,319
With the law and the president on his side

377
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,879
Mulholland set out in 1905

378
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,439
To build his Aqueduct across the desert

379
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:54,495
It was a great drama it was a great epic drama the building of that aqu

380
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:58,335
You have mule teams and you have men

381
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:01,151
They were working in Des

382
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,223
Arid conditions

383
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:10,879
Water was a problem ironically enough here in this giant water project

384
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:14,207
They had to worry about adequate water for

385
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,255
The working stock and the men

386
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:23,679
It can be almost freezing it at night and then 110° in the day

387
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:30,079
I'm practically Muhammad's there

388
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:30,847
All the time

389
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:35,711
Chief engineer Mulholland had no formal training in civil engineering

390
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:41,599
He had in fact never graduated from grade school

391
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,159
We're still Sail

392
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:48,767
And this was an engineering project the likes of which the world had really

393
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:58,495
Mulholland ordered 12 ft steel pipe forged in Germany and shipped around the horn

394
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,823
100,000 men and women worked on the aqueduct

395
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:04,895
But never more than a few thousand at a time

396
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,199
Because the exhausting and dangerous work

397
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:13,855
They have been Farm hands Cowboys

398
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,647
And hard rock miners

399
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,952
But now they were city employees

400
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,512
Civil servants like the chief himself

401
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:25,376
With air conditioning no Refrigeration no hard hats

402
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,168
110° Heat

403
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,728
They crossed the Mojave in 5 years

404
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:35,872
Locomotive

405
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,152
You know an aqueduct

406
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,176
That would have

407
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,224
All the way across

408
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,248
Massachusetts

409
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,296
And then almost all the way back

410
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,088
Through a desert

411
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,368
With

412
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:51,488
What they were really building was was the world's longest Garden

413
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:58,656
Surveyor said they could build the aqueduct simply by following the trail of whiskey

414
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:05,056
Board in 1904

415
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:11,456
In the end the chief and his lieutenants finished the

416
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:17,856
Will Holland built

417
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,648
The original Aqueduct so well

418
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:22,720
After this day it's still carries the Owens River

419
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,512
To the people of Los Angeles

420
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:29,632
The phrase Grandpa's aqued

421
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,168
That's where my my first

422
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:38,080
The day of the dedication of the aqued

423
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,152
Without

424
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:43,200
About the high point of my grandfather

425
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:43,968
Is life

426
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:52,928
Problem 30 to 40,000 Los Angeles that gather at the base of

427
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,744
There's a formal program

428
00:22:56,512 --> 00:23:00,608
But once the water spilled down the Cascade the formal program was abandoned

429
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:04,704
Because thousands of people rushed with their 10 cups to drink the water

430
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:11,872
When the water came cast getting down there

431
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,664
One who was really exhausted

432
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,224
Gave what I think is the most

433
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,784
Precise education speech and

434
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,344
He unfurled an American flag

435
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,136
He turned to the water

436
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:23,904
And he said

437
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,184
There it is

438
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:40,800
Based on mulholland's predictions it was four times more water than Los Angeles could use

439
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:54,368
Oh so slow Parkway if you're on the San Diego South at Magnolia that accident cleared to the right shoulder we're clear back

440
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,672
To the Westminster Mall with Bumper to Bumper to the beach cities

441
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,696
And if you could be

442
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:02,560
Actually has to be seen not just in terms of human

443
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,352
However brief human history

444
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,400
Has to be seen in terms of geological

445
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,168
Local time

446
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,960
Do you have for the eons

447
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,240
An environment

448
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,520
Now being

449
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,544
Found

450
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,104
Change by the changing course of that River

451
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,384
And that water

452
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,152
In effect

453
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,176
Created

454
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,736
Contemporary Los Angeles

455
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,272
It's your earthqu

456
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:29,440
This week at last subjects to Honolulu

457
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,744
SunTrust your pipeline to Paradise

458
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:36,608
Would I watch traffic celebrating this

459
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,888
Great event

460
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,424
He

461
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,448
Need a speech

462
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,984
Made the very

463
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,776
The observation he said

464
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,824
We're doomed to success

465
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,896
Might be a motto for

466
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,432
The city don't you think

467
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,808
When water came after 1913

468
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,160
It prepared for an absolute golden age of building and construction

469
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,464
That lasted through the

470
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:22,176
At one point in the early twenties there was some 67

471
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:25,760
Lumber ships at the San Pedro Harbor lined up just waiting to get the

472
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:28,576
The wood off so they could keep the construction going

473
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:31,392
You also have the beginnings of the great Hollywood fig

474
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:33,184
So coming out DW Griffith

475
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,232
Success will be Dem

476
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,280
Coming just a few months after the water

477
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:48,032
At nowhere As you move to Los Angeles will you not in the presence of Lawns edges

478
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,056
Palm trees

479
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:56,224
Great palm trees which sway above Los Angeles now like nodding giraffes

480
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:08,000
Here you had a semi-arid region

481
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:11,840
Were coyotes roamed were Tumbleweed is blown by the wind

482
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,120
Which in a very short

483
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:19,008
Was turned into arguably the most Exquisite invented Garden history

484
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,544
Now if you like that

485
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,080
With the adjacent citrus

486
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:26,176
Which we're still in full bloom and then teens in the 20s

487
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,456
I wasn't there

488
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:35,648
You had a general sensibility of that time of turning the

489
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:42,048
Desert into an Eden

490
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:44,864
Charlie Chaplin and Aldous Huxley came from England

491
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,912
William Faulkner from Mississippi

492
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,960
Frank Lloyd Wright from Wisconsin

493
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:53,056
Everyone came from everywhere

494
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:04,064
Ballet was suddenly growing 11 times faster than New York

495
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,112
Faster even than Calcutta

496
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,928
A million people by 1922

497
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:12,256
At home 31,000 were licensed real estate agent

498
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:14,560
Now

499
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,352
Over mulholland's objections

500
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:20,192
Los Angeles began annexing 52 surrounding communities

501
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,032
Soon the city limits would cover 400 square miles

502
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,336
More than any city in America

503
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:29,408
Going to be a lot of irate citizens when they find out

504
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,688
You're paying for water

505
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,992
Not going to get oh that's all taken care

506
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,208
What is simply meant was

507
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,304
You

508
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,376
You would bring the water to where

509
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,400
You wanted to bring

510
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,704
And call that place la

511
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:56,544
And and and therefore

512
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,336
You can get Los Angeles

513
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,360
Taxpayers

514
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,128
To pay

515
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,176
What in

516
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,504
A cabal of Real Estate speculators

517
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,296
To

518
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,064
City

519
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:15,232
Pay millions of dollars for them to pump water down to land that was not in fact part of the city and then caused them to

520
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,000
Hope that is part of

521
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,120
And thereby increase the value of that language they had purchased and held

522
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,472
So they were causing

523
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,752
One city in

524
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:32,128
To pay for them to develop another city by car and then say well it's really the same city

525
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,944
As the Owens River was finally

526
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,224
Being relocated

527
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:39,040
Quarter of the State of California

528
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,600
It it became

529
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,136
Immediately obvious

530
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:43,904
Yes

531
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,208
There was way more water than Los Angeles

532
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,000
And

533
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:52,608
Because the water was coming into the sand Fernando Valley it ended up irrigating

534
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,632
San Fernando

535
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:56,704
I was basically an artificial important river

536
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:58,496
For agriculture

537
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,776
We're there rather than

538
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,312
The agriculture that had been

539
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:10,016
Tracks in the San Fernando Valley

540
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:12,576
Blossomed into orange and Lemon Grove

541
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,600
Peach or

542
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,648
Fields of winter tomatoes

543
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:21,024
By 1920 LA County was the most productive Farm County in America

544
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,864
It may have been

545
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:29,472
But to move a whole river ostensibly for public good and end up

546
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,240
Making

547
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,008
A bunch of

548
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,568
Capitalists even richer than they already were

549
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:35,104
By giving them

550
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,640
A brand new

551
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:39,712
Was really a kind of a remarkable

552
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:52,512
Everything you can say everything around us I was at the hall of records today the original

553
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,304
Title for Chinatown

554
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,584
I

555
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,680
Just going to call it Water and Power

556
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:05,568
No that's what it came in and water was

557
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:06,336
Power

558
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,640
It was

559
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:10,944
It was money

560
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,296
And those who knew how to manipulate it

561
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:21,440
Alexa much more than anybody could ever manipulative

562
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,280
And you could say it

563
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:26,816
It was a

564
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,120
Running through your movie

565
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:33,216
Just a river of greed

566
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:37,312
Do you have any idea what this land would be worth with a steady

567
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,080
Supply

568
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:42,688
About 30 million more than they paid for it

569
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:50,112
The Syndicate began plowing under their newly developed San Fernando orange groves for tract homes

570
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:53,440
Advance guard of the largest subdivision in history

571
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:57,024
The value of their land had gone

572
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,048
Tenfold

573
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:03,680
This is a great age of salesmanship because these were masters of the art

574
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:06,240
I've encouraging people to Envision

575
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:09,568
On an empty Hillside the great cities the towns

576
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,616
The schools the churches the synagog

577
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,664
Which would one day be there

578
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,480
Have they but the faith that the salesman had

579
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:19,040
Owning your own home in this region

580
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:21,600
Was given an almost quasi religious

581
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,368
Value

582
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:28,512
That your children will not be delinquent if you had a home that your marriage would be happy but many of the ills of our society were due

583
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:31,328
The fact that the people lived in cities and rented

584
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,960
Mulholland himself did not profit directly from the syndicates dealings

585
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:38,752
But he was now the highest

586
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:41,312
Paid Public Employee in California

587
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:46,944
The University of California gave an honorary degree to Dr Mulholland

588
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,480
The penniless immigrant

589
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:50,272
Who never finished grade school

590
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:53,600
But could keep the entire LA water system in his head

591
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:57,184
La now had a Mulholland School

592
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,464
Mulholland

593
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,000
Mulholland Reservoir

594
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:03,072
And named its new winding Scenic Drive

595
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,912
Every kid in Hawaii

596
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:13,568
No it was one of the first names you learn when you when you hit the

597
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:19,200
When you're old enough to get a junior operator's license because that's where you parked your car to make

598
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:22,016
Until now

599
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:25,088
Once association with my

600
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,112
Hey

601
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,440
The man in the family

602
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,768
A staple of conversation water work

603
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,560
There was always a Dodge to

604
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,328
The family

605
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:40,448
Pick up to go out it was just easier to see the wildflowers in the spring but

606
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:44,544
It somehow always ended up that we were standing in front of some big

607
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:47,616
Turbine or Waterworks

608
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,920
With the men discussing

609
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,456
On just the way

610
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:52,736
You know I

611
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:57,088
I discuss impressionist paintings with a friend at the County Museum

612
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:02,976
The city which never had a reason to be now had a thousand oil

613
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:06,048
It's on automobile and airplane factories

614
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,328
And before long

615
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:10,656
90% of all the world's movies would be made in LA

616
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,728
The imported Owens River

617
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:18,848
Allow the city to expand at three times the rate Mulholland had used in his aqued

618
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:19,616
Calcul

619
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:22,688
It wasn't a profit

620
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:28,576
And that's what upset a lot of the balance

621
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:31,648
Assistance committee tried to nominate William

622
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:38,816
He said he would rather give birth to a porcupine backward than the mayor of Los Angeles

623
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:46,496
It was a scramble I mean the city kept growing and the Chamber of Commerce kept booming and there were always

624
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,544
Marvelous come on from

625
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:55,200
To the railroad companies and from the Chamber of Commerce and he he used to joke and say that he thought

626
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:58,016
The only thing is to stop LA from growing

627
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,296
Kill Frank wig

628
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:02,624
And Frank Wiggins with the president of the Chamber of commer

629
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:06,976
To spend his lifetime booming La all over the country

630
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,536
And encouraging more people

631
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:13,632
And so it was a little bit like The Sorcerer's Apprentice you start

632
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,448
The process going

633
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:23,104
And you got to have more water more water more water and you the father of the city's water system

634
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:23,872
Are supposed

635
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,920
What's the continue to provide this water

636
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:28,224
It's a terrible place to be

637
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,296
And you've got to be ingenious and inventive and come up with

638
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,576
New

639
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:34,112
We're getting water

640
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:37,952
Now there were 60,000 Realtors

641
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:44,608
The Chamber of Commerce said millions of promotional brochures to the Midwest and New England to Guatemala City

642
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,376
Paris

643
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:52,544
Only 10 years after Mulholland finished his great Aqueduct with a four-fold surplus

644
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,592
La was running out of water

645
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,896
And he was pondering new sources

646
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,432
The Colorado

647
00:34:58,944 --> 00:34:59,712
Mono Lake

648
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:00,736
Or the sier

649
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:06,880
Maybe the best example of the metamorphosis of Mulholland into an

650
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:09,696
Excessive water Seeker was described to me

651
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:11,744
Of course

652
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,024
Who was

653
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,304
Back in

654
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:17,376
20 superintendent of Yosemite National Park

655
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:20,192
And he was at the banquet table with mulholl

656
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,728
And mul

657
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,264
Started waxing

658
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,056
Eloquent about how beautiful

659
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:25,824
The valley is

660
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,360
And then I said

661
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,384
What he would do

662
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,408
If he

663
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,712
If he would send phot

664
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,016
Photograph

665
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,040
All day long

666
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,320
All

667
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,344
Every season

668
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,624
And just have

669
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,392
The most

670
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,696
Astounding collection of

671
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,720
Yosemite photograph

672
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,000
But you could ever imagine

673
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,280
Put them in books

674
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:47,584
And send them free to every library in the world

675
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:48,608
And then

676
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,144
He would go in there

677
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:52,704
And build a great big Dam

678
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:54,496
And stop the

679
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:49,280
La Rivals San Francisco was in fact planning a dam

680
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:52,352
Which would soon permanently submerge hetchy

681
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,144
Under 300 ft of water

682
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:01,824
Owens Valley had in fact gotten off easy compared to Hitachi

683
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:06,176
The southern half of the valley

684
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:10,528
Leaving the northern Townsend Farms to flourish during World War I

685
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:15,648
Well Owens Valley was an absolute team I'd say show

686
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,416
Produced

687
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:20,768
Over to get this fruit from here

688
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:25,632
I can remember when the sky would get black with flights to duck this was one of the major flyways

689
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:32,800
Absolutely black with him I mean that the sky would be black and even for a day or two

690
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,336
More for hours and hours

691
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,408
There's a great

692
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:42,272
Time to live up here it was a very close-knit Community him

693
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:45,600
Every Saturday night that keep you up for house open all night and they had

694
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:49,696
Show the movie when the movie is over they push the chairs back and everybody dance to all night

695
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:54,048
Then it have a breakfast and everybody go home back to the ranches it said something up you know

696
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:57,632
Did this every Saturday night and it was a great time to live and the only Valley

697
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:16,320
What few people knew was that William Mulholland was about to turn his attention

698
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:18,368
To what remained of the Owens River

699
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:23,232
This growing city of Los Angeles

700
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,536
Becomes like a vampire

701
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:26,816
Making a direct

702
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:31,168
Connection to the major artery of the Owens Valley which is the Owens River

703
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:33,728
And of course imagine those Ranch

704
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,384
Los Angeles will be there partner their friend that they would grow and prosperity along with the city

705
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,968
Began to see that the vampire was sucking the lifeblood and that

706
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:47,552
Fertile feels for becoming parched and non productive

707
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:55,232
In the wet years since 1905 relations between the city and the valley had been surprisingly cord

708
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:57,024
But now there was drought

709
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:01,376
The city song 52 turbine Wells into the valley floor

710
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:03,680
To pump ground water into the aqueduct

711
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,728
Crippling surrounding ranches

712
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:09,824
But people resented here they didn't have the option they didn't have a choice

713
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:13,664
And the pressure that build over 20 years and the way it was done

714
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,968
And this whole water we're talking about

715
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:18,272
Yeah they could care nothing about this property

716
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:23,136
On Sunday my mother would take me for

717
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,440
And she would always talk about

718
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,208
Apple orchard

719
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,488
And teach

720
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,792
And it wasn't till years later

721
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:32,608
That I realize because growing up in Bishop

722
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:35,168
There was always we were surrounded by sagebr

723
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:37,216
It was always dry it was always testy

724
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,776
There's always dust in the air

725
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:40,800
And

726
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:44,384
Couldn't even imagine what my mother was talking about I couldn't imagine

727
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,224
And it took me until a young adult to real

728
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,784
It was much different at one time

729
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:55,392
I would have liked to have seen

730
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:58,720
What my grandparents

731
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,816
I'd like to see the

732
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,352
I'd like to see the

733
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,912
It must have been gorgeous

734
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,192
I must have been gor

735
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,728
I mean I think that

736
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,264
50 Owens Valley

737
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,544
It's beautiful

738
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,568
I grew up there

739
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:18,944
And it's beautiful now so can you imagine what it was like

740
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:20,224
When my grandfather

741
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:22,272
When my great-grandfather

742
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,088
They can make me cry

743
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:36,096
Anger mounted as mulholland's men cut ranches canals

744
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:42,240
The city bought more land - more and more water half the crops were gone the 1924

745
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,800
Schools and businesses began to close

746
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,080
Owens

747
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,360
Went bone dry

748
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:54,528
Rumors of resistance began to fly

749
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:57,344
Someone blew a hole in the siphon

750
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,160
And then

751
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:03,232
Just before Thanksgiving in 1924

752
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:06,304
The local bank president and 100 citizens

753
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,584
Seize the aqued

754
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:11,680
They open the floodgates

755
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:15,264
And sent the entire flow of the Owens River down a ditch

756
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:26,784
They organize

757
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:30,624
Model T's that

758
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,672
Probably dozens of cars

759
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:34,208
Down to the Alabama Gates

760
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,488
On the aqueduct

761
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,024
Where there was a turnout Val

762
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,840
Where they could basically stop the flow of water to Los Angeles

763
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:42,400
Talk about Community involvement

764
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:45,216
I know that my grandfather was there

765
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:48,288
I have spoken recently with my

766
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,312
Mother

767
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:50,080
Cous

768
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,895
And she said that she remembers that it was a party

769
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,431
That her mother

770
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,711
Got her up early

771
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:57,503
And got her

772
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,551
And she was only four

773
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:01,343
So

774
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:02,623
There is

775
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,415
I mean that was a

776
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:09,279
And those people didn't move from the Alabama Gates they didn't move

777
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:12,607
I took a lot of Courage I did

778
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,783
So there was a whole bunch of

779
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:37,183
Four arbitration but discussion but interest-focused on this thing is mainly what they were after

780
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:41,279
The crowd

781
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,119
Singing on with Christian Soldiers

782
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:48,191
Playing Enrico Caruso when a hand cranked phonograph

783
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:59,199
Superintendent Mulholland sent City police to take back the water

784
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:03,039
But the local sheriff stood between the officers and the citizens

785
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:29,663
This news did travel around the world this was

786
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,943
It's a great big story

787
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,759
And it was embarrassing

788
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,039
Los Angeles

789
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:39,903
Because they were being cast as the villain and you know it was hard to see them any other way

790
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:50,399
Mahogan saw this is number one in instance of civil interaction

791
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:55,519
But saw that nothing less than the survival of Los Angeles itself was at stake

792
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,055
And it basically

793
00:43:57,311 --> 00:44:00,639
There had to be a cleansing of a farmers from that region

794
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:01,919
That the

795
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,711
Communities were incompatible

796
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:06,271
And that they would have to be bought out

797
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:11,903
And so they decided to try to sit down with some of the leaders of the Owens Valley and negotiate

798
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:12,927
Some kind

799
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:15,231
After a week

800
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:21,887
The local bank president told the Raiders that a Los Angeles Consortium would negotiate a fair price for the remaining

801
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,679
Water rights in Owens Valley

802
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,751
La would even consider sharing the water

803
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,823
With cheers and congratulations

804
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:34,175
Only to learn later

805
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:36,223
That the deal had fallen through

806
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:37,759
As

807
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:40,831
Negotiations such as they were are going on

808
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:42,111
The city is

809
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:44,159
Visually buying more

810
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,951
Rights Land and Water right

811
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:47,231
In the

812
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:48,255
Basically

813
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,279
Find the whole

814
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:53,631
While Ranch is occupied the aqueduct

815
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:54,911
City agent

816
00:44:55,167 --> 00:45:00,031
Secured legal options on virtually all remaining land and water rights in Owens Valley

817
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,823
They bought whole towns

818
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:04,639
Even the county seat and County Jail

819
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:12,575
More

820
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,623
And it's not the first time either

821
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,927
The last bombing was 4 years ago

822
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:20,511
Property

823
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,279
I

824
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:23,583
It's one of the main line

825
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,399
About 150 miles north of Los Angeles

826
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:28,703
That Supply is water to the Big Town

827
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:32,031
It's lucky Los Angeles has an emergency watershed

828
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,823
For this might have resulted

829
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,615
In a terrible drought disaster

830
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:38,943
The police are after the fiends who did this rotten

831
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,479
Let's hope they get

832
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:41,759
There's no pun

833
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:43,551
Too strong for

834
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:47,391
Give received a phone call

835
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:50,975
This is like

836
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:55,327
Telling Leonardo da Vinci that someone's just slashed the Mona Lisa

837
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,607
When he was

838
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:01,727
Appalled outraged and

839
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:03,263
Furious

840
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:04,799
Point

841
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:05,823
A certain

842
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:07,615
Ugly

843
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:09,151
Turn

844
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,943
Occurred the mood

845
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:12,735
Now

846
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,015
Night after night

847
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,831
Saboteurs Dynamite at mulholland's master walk

848
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:18,367
The great aqueduct

849
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:20,159
Ultimately depend

850
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:21,439
We had

851
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,207
Numer

852
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,999
Stories about my grandfather

853
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:26,815
Take it

854
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,119
And blowing up

855
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,423
Dynamite

856
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,191
The aqu

857
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:34,751
Pride in

858
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:35,519
Active

859
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:37,055
Of the mini r

860
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,103
Tomorrow if

861
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:42,687
There we go along and andynam

862
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:44,735
Sections and then it go right

863
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:46,015
Back up into the Hills

864
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:48,319
Would camp out for weeks and weeks and

865
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,623
After they had bonded

866
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:52,671
They were afraid to come home and

867
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:53,695
How

868
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:55,999
Their wives and kids had to basically hold

869
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,791
Whole family in Fort together

870
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:04,959
But could never win a single conviction

871
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:09,567
Heroes down in your own mind now those guys are

872
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,335
April they did and

873
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:14,687
And we wish we'd been there if we were kids you know

874
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:18,783
Interestingly enough then he went on to be

875
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,575
California state Sen

876
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:22,367
So he

877
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:23,391
Listen to Crazy Man

878
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:25,695
He was just a man on a mission and a

879
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:27,999
Mulholland and

880
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:30,303
Colleagues

881
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:31,583
Said look this is

882
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,119
This can't go on

883
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:33,887
This is

884
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,447
Threatening the

885
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,727
Your supply for a great City

886
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:39,007
This is Criminal

887
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:43,359
And they sent machine guns up there and

888
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:45,407
Trailers of them

889
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:47,199
We're going up to the Owens Valley

890
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:49,247
And basically imposing martial law

891
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:52,831
There were searchlights and flood lights up and down that Valley

892
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:54,879
Sweeping across the aqueduct

893
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:55,903
All night long

894
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:57,695
Mulholland

895
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:59,487
600 heavily armed police

896
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,791
To secure the city's water supply

897
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:05,375
Backed by the full force of state and federal law

898
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:07,167
Endorsed by the Chamber of Commerce

899
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:09,727
As German war said

900
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:13,055
Everyone has his

901
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,151
And I'm sure he had his reason

902
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:25,343
I can see how it would have been very easy to get carried away

903
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:27,391
Powerful

904
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:29,695
See what you can do

905
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,719
City

906
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,767
The Great

907
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:37,375
Why is it kidding he was

908
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:39,935
He was a bad guy he was the guy with the black hat he was

909
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:43,007
Hated him you know and we all

910
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:46,335
Talk about him a lot of evil guy was but

911
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,639
He had

912
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,407
Fant

913
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:50,175
Division

914
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:51,967
But he didn't care who stepped over to get it

915
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:56,831
He didn't care what happened to the orange valley girl it was not good

916
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:58,879
But to be a Mulholland and Owens Valley

917
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,439
I was never taken there

918
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:03,999
And my folks if they should chance

919
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:07,071
The travel my mother told me they always

920
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,351
Register to the hotel

921
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,887
Using her maiden

922
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:11,679
Because

923
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:12,703
We were

924
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:14,495
Well

925
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:17,567
It's in Owens Valley and it was not a good name

926
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:19,871
To carry

927
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,663
It was a very honest

928
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:26,015
Because he said that everyone in Bishop was the son of a b****

929
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,039
And

930
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:31,135
There wasn't enough pine trees to hang the natives on which they deserved

931
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:32,671
Where is the rest of

932
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:33,951
They went

933
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:39,327
A protocol and was invitation and so on but not Mulholland he knew that

934
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,863
It was a vein

935
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:44,703
Hope I mean to think that they could go back

936
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:50,847
The water been taken it was the Fatal complete there was no turning back

937
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,127
Owens Valley was not

938
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:52,895
Going to

939
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,967
Be reverted back to what it had been in 19

940
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:57,759
That

941
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:58,527
Been done

942
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:02,879
Somebody did put up a sign then that said Los Angeles City

943
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:04,671
Way out in the Owens Valley

944
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,487
It was really

945
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:10,047
That everyone knew William mulholl

946
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,351
He had won the valley

947
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:15,423
Before long

948
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:20,543
City bulldozers began knocking down farm houses and filling in irrigation ditch

949
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,127
Well first we

950
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:24,895
The valley

951
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:27,967
Then the settlers came in and took it away from us

952
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:30,783
Then the city of Los Angeles came and they took it away from them

953
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:45,375
All Mulholland needed now was a place to store water for the growing City

954
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,447
But former LA mayor Fred Eaton

955
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:51,263
On the only Reservoir site in Owens Valley

956
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:53,823
And was demanding a million dollars for it

957
00:50:55,615 --> 00:51:00,223
Thermal Holland built a huge dam in the Hills just 40 miles from downtown LA

958
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,271
It was the largest

959
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:03,807
Support Dam in North America

960
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:06,879
The final Link in a decade of trium

961
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:09,951
By the spring of 28

962
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:13,023
The reservoir in San Francisco Canyon

963
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:16,607
Was full to the brim with a year's supply of Owens River water

964
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:18,655
Far from the scene of battle

965
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:21,983
On March 12th

966
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:24,543
Workers noticed a small leak on the north side

967
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:27,359
Mulholland inspected the Le

968
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:30,687
Pronounced the damn sound and went home to bed

969
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:35,551
My grandfather was awakened from his sleep

970
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,343
With a phone call

971
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:40,415
Saying the dam is gone out

972
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,463
And his first

973
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:43,999
Responses he stumb

974
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:45,023
Towards the phone

975
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,095
Let's oh please God

976
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:49,375
Don't let people

977
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:50,399
Be killed

978
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,127
There was no warning

979
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:01,407
There was no warning system

980
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:04,479
And it started wiping out whole commun

981
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:10,111
You

982
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:11,903
So much water

983
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:14,719
In that damn that there

984
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:17,023
Thousand

985
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,327
Concrete

986
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,119
Riding the crest

987
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,447
It was

988
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:25,471
Not water

989
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:28,799
At a certain point it was trees

990
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:30,847
Blocks of concrete Rock

991
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:33,663
Rubble it was a semi-sol

992
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:35,711
Advancing

993
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:37,759
20 or 30 mph

994
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:59,263
I was five years old from

995
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,287
Francis

996
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:01,567
Broke

997
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:03,615
And

998
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:07,967
With my limited perceptions I real

999
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:08,735
Have some

1000
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:11,807
Beautiful thing it was like bringing a dark curtain down over

1001
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:13,855
Alight

1002
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:15,135
Area

1003
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:18,207
My father took me

1004
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:19,999
He was my father was

1005
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:21,791
Stand and he took me in the car

1006
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:23,071
My mother was not well

1007
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:23,839
Set the time

1008
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:25,887
And we drove up to

1009
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:27,167
The damn

1010
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:28,703
And on the way up

1011
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:32,799
He taught me how to say San francisquito

1012
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:33,567
Canyon

1013
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:36,127
And we rehearsed it over and over

1014
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:37,919
As if it works some kind of

1015
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:41,759
Catechism lesson and what it did for me was in print

1016
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,807
Name forever

1017
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:45,855
My mind as a scene of

1018
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:47,647
Some terrible fate

1019
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:49,695
It should be full on our family

1020
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:07,359
Mulholland surveyed the greatest man-made disaster in California history

1021
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:09,919
His Saint Francis Dam

1022
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:13,247
I killed as many people as the San Francisco earthquake

1023
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:41,663
I've always been moved all my life

1024
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:43,967
At the pictures that were taken

1025
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:48,063
Of in the morning that he went up and surveyed

1026
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,087
The ru

1027
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:51,135
I said of the damn failure

1028
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:53,439
It's like looking at

1029
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:58,303
Strict in human being I have ever seen it's a

1030
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:02,399
Stark look on his face as he stands amid the rubble

1031
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:05,471
Something he had created

1032
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:06,751
There's an engine

1033
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:10,591
Horrible say any engineer could have

1034
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:12,639
To build a structure that fail

1035
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:14,175
And also

1036
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:21,855
Grandma Holland was in the State of Shock

1037
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:24,927
He he made an initial

1038
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:30,047
Effort really it wasn't much of an effort to blame the whole thing on Dynam

1039
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:32,863
Here's which was the term he not used generically to refer to

1040
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,655
Anybody in the Owens Valley

1041
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:36,959
But it was soon very obvious

1042
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:38,239
Put the damn had

1043
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:40,031
By itself

1044
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:42,079
And nobody had sabotaged it

1045
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:44,639
And that Mulholland had had paid a visit

1046
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:46,175
To the dam just

1047
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:48,223
Hours earlier

1048
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:49,503
And I said

1049
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:50,271
It was fine

1050
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:52,831
So his

1051
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:54,367
Which

1052
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:55,647
He had been a

1053
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:57,183
In Los

1054
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:59,999
Mulholland went from being

1055
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:01,535
The father of the city

1056
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:02,815
Founder of the city

1057
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,607
To standing possible indict

1058
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:19,967
The precise cause was never found

1059
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:23,039
No criminal charges were over filed

1060
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:27,135
But the coroner's jewelry held William Mulholland responsible

1061
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:29,695
He accepted the blame

1062
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:32,511
Broke down in sobs and said that he

1063
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:33,791
Envy the Dead

1064
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:49,407
Slowly taking away the water

1065
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:50,175
On the canal

1066
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:52,735
Send the ditches and everything in slow

1067
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:55,807
But surely you know they got everything siphoned down and so the land

1068
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:57,599
The trees and no

1069
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:59,135
Upstairs they all Dale died

1070
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:02,207
All the orchard died off and they're all gone

1071
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:03,487
Vanilla house are

1072
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:05,279
They just turned back

1073
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:06,815
Into the desert if it was basic

1074
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:12,447
When we traveled to Los

1075
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:13,471
Sweet

1076
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:14,239
The

1077
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:16,287
My parents would always say

1078
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:17,823
There's our water

1079
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:21,919
Girls that water came from feeling

1080
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,479
And as

1081
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:28,575
As a child I remember feeling animosity towards

1082
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:30,367
Los Angeles

1083
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:33,183
You always knew you always

1084
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:34,463
They took our

1085
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:39,583
The Holland resigned in disgrace

1086
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:44,447
His real achievements clouded by the disaster and by the suffering in Owens Valley

1087
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:48,799
His plans were still greater aqueducts lay on the drawing board

1088
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:50,335
But do the people of LA

1089
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,615
He was an embarrassment

1090
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:55,455
Officials begin referring to the Mulholland Reservoir

1091
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:56,991
As the Hollywood Reservoir

1092
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:01,599
Owens Valley was history

1093
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:03,903
But fantasy and folklore lived on

1094
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:07,231
The myth of rampaging bullies destroying a paradise

1095
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:09,791
Dallas ranchers defending their homes

1096
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:15,679
The new Valley has been condemned

1097
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:16,703
What do you mean

1098
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:29,247
Turn the volume to a reservoir

1099
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:34,623
It's going to be built whether you like it or not

1100
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:57,663
In 1934 using mulholland's original plans

1101
00:58:57,919 --> 00:59:00,991
The Metropolitan water district blasted a new aqueduct

1102
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:04,575
All the way to the Arizona State Line to its second river

1103
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:05,599
The Colorado

1104
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:15,327
To bring in water from an outside sour

1105
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:20,447
Against the serious water short

1106
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:26,847
A water source capable of supplying our

1107
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:29,663
Is the Colorado River

1108
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:36,319
The governor of Arizona deployed his State militia to The Rivers Bank

1109
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:39,647
To stop Los Angeles from taking Colorado River water

1110
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:52,191
It was to no avail

1111
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:57,567
Final resolution would not come until 30 years later

1112
00:59:57,823 --> 01:00:00,895
After one of the longest court cases in American history

1113
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:04,991
On the day when the Waters of the Colorado River rushed through the attack with us

1114
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:11,391
The greatest engineering speed of its kind never accomplished we'll take his place among the wonders of the world

1115
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:17,535
It is a wonderful thing to contemplate

1116
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:19,583
This new con

1117
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:21,375
Of the Great Southwest

1118
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:23,935
For everything that man desires

1119
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:24,703
This

1120
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:27,007
Everything except sufficient water

1121
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:28,799
Where's sufficient water

1122
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:30,591
We can be assured

1123
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:31,359
Have a great

1124
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:33,407
And a stable civilization

1125
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:37,759
Wow what a day

1126
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:42,879
I'm afraid we're going to be busy hi Greg it was a high speed Pursuit earlier this morning

1127
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:49,279
Investigation but for the bumper to

1128
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:33,055
He brought enough elements together

1129
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:34,079
Water

1130
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:36,127
Well

1131
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:39,711
So that Los Angeles was now almost condemned

1132
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:40,735
To grow

1133
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:47,391
After

1134
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,927
The 1920s

1135
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:51,999
Los Angeles's history is almost

1136
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:53,023
Define

1137
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:54,047
By

1138
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:54,815
Obsess

1139
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:58,399
Search for more and more water

1140
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:00,191
Hoover Dam

1141
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:04,031
Authorized in 1928 finished by the mid 30s

1142
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,567
Then mono

1143
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:09,151
Which is a north of the Owens Valley

1144
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:11,199
Was hooked up to the aqueduct

1145
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:13,759
And begins reading all the streams that feed this

1146
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:16,063
Irreplaceable natural wonder out there

1147
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:19,647
Mulholland had long had his eye on mono

1148
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:22,207
100 miles north of Owens Valley

1149
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:23,999
In 1936

1150
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:29,119
His successors dusted off his plans and pushed the aqueduct North to Mono

1151
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:32,447
Speaking again the greatest good for the greatest number

1152
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:39,359
People really shouldn't have any problem with our water system and take it for granted or the water people aren't doing their

1153
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:42,943
How I felt that I was working for a good Purp

1154
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:44,735
I wasn't

1155
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:48,319
Doing something that in my view

1156
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:50,879
Really didn't basically benefit

1157
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:52,671
Society

1158
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:55,231
I felt that I was working on something

1159
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:57,535
Was it was a fundamental benefit

1160
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:58,815
Society I was proud

1161
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:04,191
The people of La could now depend on water from ancient streams

1162
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,471
Feeding mono

1163
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:13,151
This is the desert this is the Grim waterless waste that covered most of Los Angeles

1164
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:46,687
Make the most of their mild seductive crime

1165
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:52,575
Optimism

1166
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:02,815
The rise of Nazis in Germany

1167
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:07,167
Have the creation of a Euro Southern California

1168
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:09,983
Auto preminger who is the course playing the Nazis

1169
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:11,775
Was at the Hillcrest Country Club

1170
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:13,567
And people

1171
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:14,335
Playing

1172
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:17,151
People were talking and these two people start talking and Hungarian

1173
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:20,479
And they're talking with hungry and not a promise you said

1174
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:21,503
What's the

1175
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:25,599
She said talk German

1176
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:38,655
From Berlin New York Alabama from

1177
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:41,983
All over the world people flooded into Southern California

1178
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:46,079
They said it was just like everywhere else

1179
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:50,943
Only more so

1180
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:54,271
It's something like that

1181
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:56,063
That's not like

1182
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:58,111
You know love and good

1183
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:00,415
But he really miss it by its

1184
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:01,183
It's very

1185
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:05,023
This wasn't aware I was never aware growing up

1186
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:07,327
Wonderful it was

1187
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:09,375
Until it was

1188
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:10,911
Gone and that was the air it

1189
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:13,727
The air was wonderful

1190
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:21,663
But he's stopping think about

1191
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:24,735
Temperature of

1192
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:28,063
The climate here year-round

1193
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:29,087
Probably

1194
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:31,647
The most perfect limit

1195
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:34,719
With almost no clothing

1196
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:35,487
Is it

1197
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:36,511
The

1198
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:42,655
But it's almost an extension of your own skin it

1199
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:44,959
God is not too cold

1200
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:51,615
The Machinery of water acquisition overworked the Owens River

1201
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:53,663
Colorado and the mono basin

1202
01:05:54,175 --> 01:06:00,319
In 1964 the Metropolitan water district proposed diverting the Columbia River to Southern

1203
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:01,087
California

1204
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:02,879
The future had arrived

1205
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:04,927
Somebody finally decided

1206
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:05,951
Rather than

1207
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:07,743
Just go after another sour

1208
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:08,511
Of water

1209
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:11,071
Every 10 or 20 years why don't we go

1210
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:12,863
To where there's so much water

1211
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:14,399
We'll have enough for 200

1212
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:15,935
And where was that

1213
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:17,727
Alaska

1214
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:19,519
It would have brought

1215
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:21,823
This water down in Hu

1216
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:26,175
Irrigated Nevada irrigated Eastern Oregon on the way

1217
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:30,015
Some of it would have gone all the way to Mexico it was going to go to Arizona it was going to go to

1218
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:31,551
Nobody

1219
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:32,575
Really BL

1220
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:36,159
There were lots of people in the business who thought well yeah

1221
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:38,719
Maybe a little premature but this is going to happen

1222
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:44,351
But rather

1223
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:46,143
Preview of an atomic Marvel

1224
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:46,911
I love tomorrow

1225
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:49,215
Stone in men's development

1226
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:55,359
A nuclear powered agro-industrial complex with a nuclear reactor as the

1227
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:56,127
Cheese

1228
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:06,367
Industrial complex

1229
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:08,671
They were plans the last two

1230
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:09,695
You know what

1231
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:10,975
Iceberg

1232
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:11,999
I'm down

1233
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:19,423
You know it was like the flim-flam man I mean there was no end to these people who had plans

1234
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:21,215
The damn San Francisco

1235
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:22,239
Francisco Bay

1236
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:26,335
Pipelines Beyond Your Wildest Dreams

1237
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:29,663
This one this wasn't about carrying oil

1238
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:31,455
This was about carrying water

1239
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:32,991
This is this is water

1240
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:45,023
Chris at the time

1241
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,815
Nobody was

1242
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:49,375
Challenging the idea of

1243
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:51,167
Using 8 gall

1244
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:51,935
Of water

1245
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:53,215
Prof

1246
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:53,983
To the toilet

1247
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:57,311
Irrigating your law

1248
01:07:58,335 --> 01:08:00,383
To the point where it's standing an inch deep in water

1249
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:02,431
Nobody thought about conservation

1250
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:09,855
The city had long since exhausted Supply from the tiny Los Angeles River

1251
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:12,927
And cemented over its Channel by 1960

1252
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:20,863
The DWP built a reservoir to store a supply of Owens River water near the center of

1253
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:21,631
Los Angeles

1254
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:29,311
The Los Angeles city police helicopter is here the Los Angeles City Fire Department helicopter is here

1255
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:35,711
Police are on the ground with motorcycles and automobile trying to effectively activate people from here

1256
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:42,111
So they can't possibly be any more loss of life than there is property no telling how much property

1257
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:48,511
Has already been lost triangle shaped

1258
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:54,911
Reservoir

1259
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:20,255
The department of order and power had no choice but to carry on

1260
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:21,535
Since it now served

1261
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:22,815
3 million people

1262
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:28,191
In 1966 La acquired its Third River

1263
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:31,775
Like a giant version of mulholland's Owens Valley Project

1264
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:36,383
The California state Aqueduct now brought the Feather River from 600 miles north

1265
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:38,943
Enough water to fill the Rose Bowl

1266
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:39,967
Every 90 minutes

1267
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:43,295
Los Angeles

1268
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:45,855
By the '70s was reaching

1269
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:50,975
200 mi in One Direction 250 mi in another Direction and 600 MI

1270
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:52,255
In a third

1271
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:53,279
For water

1272
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:55,071
It still

1273
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:56,095
Enough

1274
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:02,239
In 1970 the Department of Water and Power

1275
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:04,543
Using mulholland's original sketches

1276
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:06,079
Finished the second Barrel

1277
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:15,551
Sucking now twice as much water from Mono Lake

1278
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:18,623
Logan year old Lake now fell to feed every year

1279
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:23,743
It was the only stop for a million migrating seabirds

1280
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:26,303
On their way from the Arctic to Bolivia

1281
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:32,447
We can see the light going down and down and then I'm pretty sure it wasn't anything growing around the lake anymore

1282
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:34,495
Everything was drying up all

1283
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:36,799
Springs were dying

1284
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:38,847
You know that was that was really

1285
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:41,919
Devastating because we thought

1286
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:43,455
The whole lake is going to be

1287
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:45,503
And

1288
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:49,855
When you think of God's given like you think it should be like it was

1289
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:56,255
The local people had already resigned themselves to the fact that the lake was going to dry up or get to a very small level

1290
01:10:56,767 --> 01:11:02,911
Just because of the adversary Department of Water and Powers too big to fight it was not

1291
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:09,311
Anything that anybody could do great Alkali dust storms begin boiling up off the exposed

1292
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:10,079
Hours of mon

1293
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:12,127
And the dry bed of Owens Lake

1294
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:14,175
A 1974

1295
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:15,199
Owens Valley

1296
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:21,599
The Switzerland of America had the worst particular pollution in the country the

1297
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:22,879
Since

1298
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:24,927
Somehow La had thinned

1299
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:25,695
Against

1300
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:27,231
Another

1301
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:27,999
People

1302
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:32,863
Became a central imagery in this whole water story

1303
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:34,911
And one that I've always

1304
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:35,679
Have a lot of

1305
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:36,447
Of trouble with

1306
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:37,983
Because I've always

1307
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:41,055
Sympathize with the underdog

1308
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:45,663
At the same time I've been proud of my grandfather so it's giving me a great deal of conflict

1309
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:46,431
I have

1310
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:47,967
Come to term

1311
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:48,735
Without

1312
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:50,015
Why are you doing it

1313
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:52,831
How much better can you eat what can you buy

1314
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:55,647
You can already afford

1315
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:57,439
The future

1316
01:11:57,951 --> 01:11:58,975
And the

1317
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:01,279
In the name of the future

1318
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:02,815
Against the future

1319
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:05,375
It's really the

1320
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:07,167
California

1321
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:12,799
Is the Supreme IR

1322
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:17,919
Face the

1323
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:24,319
The right time in the right place they're capable of somet

1324
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:25,343
There's some some

1325
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:26,111
Monsters

1326
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:29,439
Figure out how to punish

1327
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:30,207
So

1328
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:32,255
They actually sort of reward

1329
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:33,535
Let me know

1330
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:36,863
On the scenic route of the city

1331
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:40,191
My family's names are on

1332
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:41,727
Tax

1333
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:42,751
So they found

1334
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:46,335
Rather than in jail where they're

1335
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:49,663
But I think a movie like Chinatown is an easy out

1336
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:52,479
It oversimplifies its melodramatic

1337
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:53,503
It's not true

1338
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:54,783
I mean not literally

1339
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:57,855
But it provides a rather easy

1340
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:00,927
Explanation

1341
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:04,767
And for people who like to bash la

1342
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:06,047
It's perfect

1343
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:07,839
New York

1344
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:11,935
Hold it up with a piece of his

1345
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:19,103
The movie Chinatown Was Bad contorted history

1346
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:21,151
But it was powerful my

1347
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:24,991
Rekindling violence against the Department of Water and Power

1348
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:30,111
Now headquartered in a building that cost as much as mulholland's original aqueduct

1349
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:34,463
There was violence here before a long time ago

1350
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:38,815
Back in 1924 angry farmers and ranchers line the wall

1351
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:40,607
Armed with shotguns and rifles

1352
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,655
They blue holes in the aqued

1353
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:43,935
17

1354
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:45,471
This year it took

1355
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:46,239
This

1356
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:49,567
A dynamite blast at the gates of the first aqueduct

1357
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:52,127
The water for Los Angeles stopped

1358
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:52,895
Briefly

1359
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:00,831
And the population of bish

1360
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:04,415
More in fact than the entire population of Owens Valley

1361
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:05,695
But this time

1362
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:06,975
Something had changed

1363
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:09,535
David Gaines

1364
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:14,143
A young biologist from LA and a dozen University of California students

1365
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:17,983
Had begun a careful study of mono Lakes singular ecosystem

1366
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:21,055
They found it on the brink of collapse

1367
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:25,663
We knew about Owens Lake of course no just a dry

1368
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:32,319
You know 100 miles to the South and we realized I didn't want to like could look like that someday and

1369
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:35,647
Once you realize what was here that all that would be

1370
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:36,415
To

1371
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:37,183
Couldn't let it

1372
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:40,255
Just go down without making some effort to save it

1373
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:45,887
Mono Lake had fallen 40 f

1374
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:50,751
Exposing mineral Towers which had formed underwater over the ages

1375
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:54,591
It had become three times saltier than the ocean

1376
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:57,151
What we are asking

1377
01:14:57,407 --> 01:15:00,735
Asking what Mona Lake is asking all of us is where are we going to draw the line

1378
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:01,759
If we don't

1379
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:07,391
Share some water with Mono Lake what will be next will it be like Tahoe will be the Eel River the Yukon

1380
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:12,767
Will it be on and on until the last of our singing rivers and beautiful lakes are gone

1381
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:14,559
Because we've taken every last drop

1382
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:16,863
We've watched the last waterfowl

1383
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:18,655
The last salmon

1384
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:23,263
Follow the California state emblem the California grizzly into Oblivion

1385
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:25,567
It is a Battleground in that sense

1386
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:26,591
It's asking us

1387
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:30,943
How much are we going to share with the Earth

1388
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:32,735
Primitive

1389
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:34,015
I mean

1390
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:38,623
12 people only one or two cars everybody else did their research

1391
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:39,391
Be

1392
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:45,791
They take their binoculars in their backpack and their lunch and hop on their bikes and they'd ride down the dirt roads and

1393
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:48,863
Dump their bikes and Hike out for a couple miles

1394
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:50,655
Going to walk through mud and

1395
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:53,471
They were really the

1396
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:55,007
Quintessential

1397
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:57,055
Researchers out there

1398
01:15:57,311 --> 01:16:02,175
Braving the elements

1399
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:03,711
I got big beards

1400
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:05,503
And so

1401
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:07,807
Mr Gaines he was one of them y'all

1402
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:10,367
He looked just like

1403
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:11,391
The rest of your

1404
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:14,719
I like it kind of like a hippy I'd say but I don't want to say

1405
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:18,815
But he

1406
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:20,351
It's pretty smart that guy

1407
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:23,423
It started things going here

1408
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:28,799
When I grew up in Los Angeles I never learned where water came from

1409
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:35,455
And it was only after doing some complex calculations that we learned that if diversions

1410
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:39,807
This Lake will fall another 40 to 60 vertical feet

1411
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:41,343
What we will be left

1412
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:42,111
Up with

1413
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:43,647
Is an Alkali Wast

1414
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:47,231
A sterile chemical sump where there is now one of the most

1415
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:48,255
Beautiful

1416
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:49,535
And life productive

1417
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:50,303
This is on Earth

1418
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:57,983
Far more than natural beauty was threatened at Mono Lake

1419
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:03,103
What was at stake was

1420
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:04,383
A big

1421
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:10,783
Aquatic ecosystem is very simple but very productive I mean the numbers are astronomical you got

1422
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:12,319
And then the brine shrimp

1423
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:16,159
Ethiology and then you've got millions of birds coming every summer

1424
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:18,207
Keith O'Brien flies in a brine shrimps

1425
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:23,839
Dream was out there

1426
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:25,631
But I don't think we

1427
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:28,703
We gazed up at it too much it might be too discouraging

1428
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:31,007
I mean to have a handful of biologist

1429
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:36,895
Fighting the Department of Water and Power of the city of Los Angeles with a multi-million dollar

1430
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:37,663
Budget

1431
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:39,455
Was too big of a contrast

1432
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:45,599
When William Mulholland took water from Owens Valley and Mono Lake years before

1433
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:47,647
No one questioned the dam

1434
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:48,415
To Nature

1435
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:52,511
But an environmental movement had come of age in America

1436
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:54,559
Along with powerful new law

1437
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:56,863
And a great shift in public opinion

1438
01:17:57,887 --> 01:18:00,447
Committees at Mono Lake and Owens Valley

1439
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:04,031
Went to court

1440
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:08,639
To stop the water Conquest Mulholland had said in Motion in 1905

1441
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:10,687
If you're angry and have nothing

1442
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:12,479
No other recourse

1443
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:14,527
I think Dynamite comes to mind

1444
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:18,367
And they were ranchers they understood Dynamite we were College biologist

1445
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:19,903
No experience with Dynam

1446
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:28,095
We knew facts and figures and we knew that we could you know we're educated people and we could probably figure out how

1447
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:31,423
Find lobbyists to go

1448
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:34,239
To help us in Sacramento and how to find lawyers

1449
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:40,639
People are saying well ask for a lot at go way high and then you compromise down with the politicians and the agencies and

1450
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:42,943
We are all biologist because I said

1451
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:44,735
It doesn't sound right

1452
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:47,807
Why can't we just start with what we know is the truth

1453
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:49,599
And just stay there forever

1454
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:51,391
And that's what we did

1455
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:57,279
The Court's rule that drying out the Owens River or streams feeding Mono Lake

1456
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:58,815
Was not in the public interest

1457
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:00,863
In 1988

1458
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:05,727
Force the city to return water to Mono for the first time in half a

1459
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:11,871
Los Angeles began water conservation on a scale never before seen in America

1460
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:14,943
And now shares the water in a fragile piece

1461
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:16,223
With Owens Valley

1462
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:17,247
And mono

1463
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:20,575
Local person said

1464
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:23,647
If you guys save the lake I'll eat my hat

1465
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:31,583
It turns out that we've saved the lake and we have the regulations and people seem much happier BC water running down the

1466
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:32,863
Make fish in the creek

1467
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:35,423
Maybe some of them remember

1468
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:39,263
The great numbers of ducks and geese that were down at the lake and they look forward to that

1469
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:41,055
Being in the future again

1470
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:47,711
I didn't think that they would succeed

1471
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:52,063
Persuading the city of Los Angeles to let the water in again

1472
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:55,391
Why did you think that they would not

1473
01:19:58,975 --> 01:20:01,535
How can you find the city of Los Angeles

1474
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:05,119
So really this is a victory a great victory

1475
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:12,287
David Gaines did not live to see the victory

1476
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:16,384
He had died a year before in an automobile accident

1477
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,920
Not far from Mono Lake

1478
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:31,232
And so finally the the machine that Mulholland

1479
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:32,512
Set in motion

1480
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:34,816
Just kind of

1481
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:35,840
Began to fall

1482
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,400
Hit the

1483
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:39,680
The whole

1484
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:44,032
Picture of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and the city changed

1485
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:45,824
The city negotiated

1486
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:46,848
With Mono Lake

1487
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:49,920
Folks and decided to give more water back to the lake

1488
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:51,456
It gave up

1489
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:57,856
On the idea of importing Klamath river water or Columbia River water

1490
01:20:59,392 --> 01:20:59,904
It

1491
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:01,184
People's feeling

1492
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:07,584
I bring more water in if it just encourages more growth that forces

1493
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,376
Just to bring more water in you know

1494
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:10,912
It's a sort of a

1495
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:11,680
Or

1496
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:12,448
It's the

1497
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:15,776
Queen and Alice in Wonderland running faster and faster

1498
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:19,360
And

1499
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:20,896
Mentality

1500
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:23,200
Has it sort of died and respectful death

1501
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:26,784
You know if there's an occasional short

1502
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:28,576
Well that's too bad

1503
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:30,368
We're in the desert here

1504
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:31,904
And we're not supposed to be

1505
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:33,184
Like Miami

1506
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:35,232
All the time every day of the year

1507
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:37,280
To Infinity

1508
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:48,032
After the damn failure my grandfather underwent

1509
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:52,640
The most profound change that you can imagine and

1510
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:54,944
But he had been a vigorous

1511
01:21:58,016 --> 01:22:03,136
Functioning 70-year-old man or 72-year-old man at the time of the

1512
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:03,904
Faile

1513
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:05,440
And he simply

1514
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:07,232
Shrive

1515
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:09,536
He come out to the ranch

1516
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:12,608
She needs to sit in the living room with this cigar and

1517
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:20,288
Conversation would go around and he would he would just shut his eyes he would sit there like some kind of

1518
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,104
Sleeping GI

1519
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:30,272
I was so

1520
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:31,552
The child when I attend

1521
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:32,320
The funeral

1522
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:34,368
And his body

1523
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:35,648
State and city hall

1524
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:37,696
And

1525
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:38,976
The Working Man

1526
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:40,512
You came to pay their

1527
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:41,280
Specs

1528
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:43,072
And some of them cried

1529
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:48,448
When I was 12 years old and that made a big impression on me cuz I had never seen

1530
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:49,984
Grown man cry

1531
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:51,776
And

1532
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:55,104
I derived from that that this was the man who

1533
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:58,176
Commanded a lot of love and respect in his day

1534
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:01,504
And I've spent a lifetime trying to

1535
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:03,296
Died that with all the

1536
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,880
Facts that have been made on him by people who didn't know

1537
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:17,120
Freeways are settling down believe it or not we check on the 405 and the 101

1538
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:18,144
Leaving the Hollywood Hills

1539
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,192
Not bad at all don't need to take

1540
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:21,728
The Roots such as

1541
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:23,520
Laurel Canyon Coldwater

1542
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:24,800
Canyon or even Bowl

1543
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:25,824
Drive

1544
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:27,872
I'm Dr road map fly

1545
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:28,896
For Captain Jorge

1546
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:30,432
Ninja copter 7

1547
01:24:57,472 --> 01:24:58,496
Down to the last

1548
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:04,896
Drop on orders from the interior Secretary of the United States

1549
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:11,296
This was the first River on Earth to come under complete human control the only River in a thousand

1550
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:13,344
Miles of desert so hot and dry

1551
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:23,072
Today 30 million people depend on the Waters of the Colorado

1552
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:26,144
This is the story

1553
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,936
Of how that came to be

1554
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:35,104
Las Vegas isn't supposed to be here no one dreamed there would ever be

1555
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:38,432
Las Vegas on the Colorado River that in

1556
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:39,968
Stark Baron Des

1557
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:42,528
People would actually want to live

1558
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:47,392
And develop a community and build a city in it people don't come to Las Vegas

1559
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:48,416
Because

1560
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:50,208
Carefully analyzed our

1561
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:56,096
They come here because the economic potential is there we have the jobs

1562
01:25:56,352 --> 01:26:00,192
And we keep building Mega resorts on the strip

1563
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:05,312
And we have a vibrant economy we pay no taxes

1564
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:07,360
Gaming is footing the bill for us

1565
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:14,784
Out of

1566
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:21,184
Alligator

1567
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:23,232
Community

1568
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:39,104
Las Vegas is only one of a dozen cities feeding on the Colorado

1569
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:47,552
Here it rains 3 in a year

1570
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:49,088
About the same as in EG

1571
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:55,232
Every week a thousand people move to Las Vegas

1572
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:59,584
And each of them will use 350 gallons of cool clear water

1573
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:00,608
Everyday

1574
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:07,776
Why are you in the desert you shouldn't even be in the desert if you people would just send everybody away

1575
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:09,568
You wouldn't have this problem

1576
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:12,128
If you'd like

1577
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:14,176
Like this kind of growth in your community

1578
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:17,248
All these people

1579
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:19,040
I'll have to go somewhere in this country

1580
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:22,624
The Colorado River is the lifeblood of the Southwest

1581
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:27,232
Without the Colorado without a stable water supply the Southwest would not look anything like it does

1582
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:28,512
Without

1583
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:29,280
Water

1584
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:31,328
Without flowing water

1585
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:33,888
All these desert places that we have

1586
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:36,448
Settled and made populous

1587
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:39,264
I really really unbearable

1588
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:40,032
Environment

1589
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:47,712
It All Began in 1857

1590
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:53,088
When Joseph Christmas eyes ran a steamboat up to the desolate spot for Las Vegas now stands

1591
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:54,880
Stopped by rapid

1592
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:55,904
He said

1593
01:27:56,160 --> 01:28:00,000
The Colorado River shall be forever on visited and undisturbed

1594
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:01,280
And turn back

1595
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:05,632
But in 1869

1596
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:07,424
John Wesley pow

1597
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:09,472
Set off down the mysterious River

1598
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:11,520
His was the last

1599
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:14,848
Great scientific Expedition inside the United States

1600
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,128
Entering the last

1601
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:17,152
Part of the West

1602
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:18,688
Unpenetrated by

1603
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:25,600
The river Powell explored

1604
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:26,368
Was

1605
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:33,280
Well you have to give him Credit One Arm going down that River didn't do a thing about it

1606
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:36,864
They had no idea where they'd find waterfalls

1607
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:41,472
The kind of Rapid said run into and I remember

1608
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:47,872
The first time I went down and I had to worry about whether that roar I heard in the distance

1609
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:51,712
The waterfall 100 ft or just

1610
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:52,480
Little

1611
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:59,904
We now administer the Colorado and a great system of water works but in a few places

1612
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:07,072
Power was a king's skeptical Observer

1613
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:12,704
Determined to learn whether Americans could realistically settle the land along the Colorado

1614
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:20,384
Bed by snow melt and rare violent storms

1615
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:22,944
It was America's Sylvia's River

1616
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:24,736
And one of the world's warmest

1617
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,040
No River on Earth

1618
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:31,392
The river was

1619
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:36,256
Willful headstrong it would flow at

1620
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:39,328
Flow of the Mississippi at low water

1621
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:40,096
A little

1622
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:41,120
Canyon really

1623
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:44,192
I mean the Grand Canyon is huge but the actual

1624
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:45,984
Riverbed

1625
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:46,752
It's small

1626
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:48,544
And this River would rise

1627
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:49,568
70 f

1628
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:53,152
It ran wild for 2 or 3 months every year and

1629
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:54,944
It would get down to a trickle

1630
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:56,224
In August

1631
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:56,992
September

1632
01:29:57,504 --> 01:30:00,576
The fluctuations on the Colorado River is is amazing

1633
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:03,136
It's just not a very predictable

1634
01:30:03,392 --> 01:30:03,904
River

1635
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:10,560
It was an outlaw River and we couldn't let it not the regulated and that's why I think

1636
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:16,192
I think it wasn't just that it was the only significant River in the southwest but that it was

1637
01:30:16,448 --> 01:30:17,216
So

1638
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:21,312
This this nature that we say we love wild we really like it quite well regul

1639
01:30:21,824 --> 01:30:23,360
And we went after the

1640
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:26,176
Colorado River with a kind

1641
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:26,944
The special

1642
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:34,624
How questioned whether the river could be controlled whether it could water the Arid West and weather it could be

1643
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:39,744
Fairly divided Americans have bitterly debated the Colorado ever since

1644
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:41,536
This year

1645
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:48,448
All of whom lay some claim to its Waters

1646
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:55,104
Who wants this River everyone wants this River everyone in the southwestern United States and

1647
01:30:55,360 --> 01:31:01,504
Northwestern Mexico as you flow down here it's hard to realize but this river is really cool

1648
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:03,296
I'm Phoenix Tucson

1649
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:09,696
Providing substantial amount of the water supply for Southern California Southern

1650
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:16,096
Nevada provide substantial habitat for all kinds of Aquatic Life there's a lot of people

1651
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:17,376
People competing for this River

1652
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:18,656
When I was born

1653
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:24,544
1912 there were no dams in the Colorado River it was a Wild River all from start to finish

1654
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:27,616
Thought it was all right I think the rivers to run to the ocean

1655
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:29,920
That was their idea it was probably a good one

1656
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:31,456
There

1657
01:31:31,712 --> 01:31:37,088
There's a cry practically Nationwide to control the wild raging rampant Colorado River

1658
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:43,488
Flooded The Yuma Valley in the all the irrigation land down there flooded every year without questioning it it was just

1659
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,840
There needed to be some control structure on the Colorado to to stop those

1660
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:49,632
Devastating annual floods

1661
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:52,192
For all its Fury

1662
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:57,056
Only a 30th the flow of the Mississippi

1663
01:31:57,312 --> 01:32:00,640
But it was the biggest river in a thousand miles of desert

1664
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:03,968
In 1922

1665
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:07,552
Herbert Hoover convened western states to divide the river's water

1666
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:11,136
Half was claimed by the mountain states

1667
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:12,928
For the rain and snow fell

1668
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:14,976
And half by the desert States

1669
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:17,536
For most of the farms in cities would be

1670
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:21,632
So much

1671
01:32:22,656 --> 01:32:25,472
But the compact Reserve no water for Native Americans

1672
01:32:25,728 --> 01:32:27,008
And little for Mexico

1673
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:29,824
Within a year

1674
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:33,920
Bureau of Reclamation surveyors had located dozens of damn sites

1675
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:42,624
The prime damn site was in a remote Canyon called GL

1676
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:46,976
But the bureau on the fierce pressure from California congressman

1677
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:48,768
Chose Instead The Narrows

1678
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:49,792
Of Black Canyon

1679
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:51,072
300 M

1680
01:32:52,096 --> 01:32:54,400
To the exploding population of Los Angeles

1681
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:57,728
The first great dam would be here

1682
01:32:57,984 --> 01:33:00,800
A few miles from the Tiny Village of Las Vegas

1683
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:07,712
Hoover Dam to me was a

1684
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:09,248
I expected

1685
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:11,040
Unbeliev

1686
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:12,576
The man

1687
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:13,600
Okay I could

1688
01:33:13,856 --> 01:33:14,368
It to start

1689
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:17,440
No damn that size could be built

1690
01:33:17,696 --> 01:33:18,976
People didn't know how to do it

1691
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:21,024
Who would pay for it it was

1692
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:23,584
A huge leap into the realm of the unknown

1693
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:28,448
No one had ever before stopped a river of this size

1694
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:32,544
Hoover Dam would stop floods

1695
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:33,824
Irrigate Farm

1696
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:36,896
Generate low cost power for homes and factories

1697
01:33:37,664 --> 01:33:39,968
It would be bigger than the Great Pyramid of Egypt

1698
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,784
Three times as tall as the Statue of Liberty

1699
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:54,048
This was a depression like you never saw

1700
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:56,352
And I felt very

1701
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:58,912
That I could come to Boulder City

1702
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:05,824
And go to work on Hoover Boulder Dam whichever one you prefer to call it works started here in 19

1703
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:12,224
And the dam was dedicated on September 30th of 1935 by Franklin Roosevelt

1704
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:30,400
Of course the first thing you have to do is get the river out of your way we made tunnels Through The Rock

1705
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:43,200
I get it out of her way so we can get down to bedrock and then start the construction of

1706
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:46,528
Damn and the river is not very anxious

1707
01:34:46,784 --> 01:34:47,808
To change this channel

1708
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:54,208
Cuz you gradually squeeze it down you can throw the Taj Mahal in there and the river moves

1709
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:55,232
Come down river

1710
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,792
And what a thrill it was

1711
01:34:58,048 --> 01:35:00,864
That water gushed through those big diversion tun

1712
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:05,216
And we went down

1713
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:09,824
Through the desert to an Overlook and we could see it being constructed

1714
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:14,688
My father had me up on his shoulders looking out cuz we were looking down over that in

1715
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:17,248
Just terrifying but fascin

1716
01:35:20,064 --> 01:35:22,368
A million little ants running down there

1717
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:28,512
They got $5 a

1718
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:32,352
If they have just enough to wrestle a jackhammer up there 5

1719
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:39,520
Were cleared out of that particular area where the shot

1720
01:36:01,536 --> 01:36:06,400
Not just to see these high schoolers work off of boats and chair attached to a rope

1721
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:09,216
Some of those guys could spring around like monkey

1722
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:14,592
And the basket that was being lowered down into the

1723
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:15,360
Canyon

1724
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:17,152
Oh I wanted to get on

1725
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:19,968
Not so bad and right down it just looked like a barrel of fun

1726
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:25,088
We just change shift

1727
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:27,904
Kind of hard to swish swash of an arrow

1728
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:30,976
Tumbling tumbling tumb

1729
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:33,792
From way up there

1730
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:35,072
And

1731
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:36,096
Quite

1732
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:38,400
I was stand

1733
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:40,704
And I made a Mad Dash over to this guy

1734
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:44,288
But along

1735
01:36:44,544 --> 01:36:46,080
Hard boiled superintend

1736
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:49,664
He said to me

1737
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:53,760
What are you going to do with all these blackity black truck

1738
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:59,136
I said there's a man killed over here we'll get a moving this guy can't hurt anybody

1739
01:36:59,392 --> 01:37:00,928
Keeping those trucks moving

1740
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:04,256
Was more important than anything

1741
01:37:05,024 --> 01:37:05,792
You know

1742
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:07,840
We got to get this damn

1743
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:09,376
I just bring that up

1744
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:10,912
Is dial highball

1745
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:12,704
This job was

1746
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:16,544
It was on June 6th 1933

1747
01:37:17,056 --> 01:37:18,592
That's the first bucket of concrete

1748
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:21,152
Was placed in the very lowest of the damn form

1749
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,016
What a few months previously

1750
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:28,320
Had blowed the unchallenged Colorado

1751
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:33,696
The plan of the structure became app

1752
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:38,048
Getting that concrete down into that

1753
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:39,072
Canyon

1754
01:37:39,584 --> 01:37:42,912
120° heat and I just

1755
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:45,216
Does that man was able to do a thing like

1756
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:51,616
Degrees 140 in the tunnels

1757
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:58,016
In the first month killed a worker every two days

1758
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:09,280
San Francisco to New York City it had

1759
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:11,072
Much much

1760
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:13,888
Much more Concrete in it than the Empire State Building

1761
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:14,656
I mean

1762
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:15,680
Dozens of

1763
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:18,752
Except for

1764
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:23,360
Corridors inside it's an elevators it's absolutely solid

1765
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:36,928
The best way from up here I've found to help everybody judge signs if you look at the vehicles driving back and forth across the top of it

1766
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:56,128
So big and my father and mother said the water is coming in it's making electricity power that's what

1767
01:38:56,384 --> 01:38:58,944
I feel down in the dam I feel it the

1768
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:01,248
What self is a powerful structure

1769
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:02,784
How to look what it's holding back

1770
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:06,368
Imagine what a reservoir the size of Lake Mead

1771
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:13,024
Ways imagine the weight and all that weight wants to go down river it doesn't have

1772
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:13,792
Have

1773
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:14,560
Other

1774
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:15,328
Passion

1775
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:16,608
But to go

1776
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:17,632
Downriver

1777
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:19,936
And the only thing stopping it is

1778
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:21,216
Thumb

1779
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:24,032
700 ft thumb

1780
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:33,504
Yes I stood on that Transformer deck and looked at that magnificent concrete structure

1781
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:34,272
Couldn't help but

1782
01:39:34,528 --> 01:39:38,112
Thinking that tears something greater than the pyramids is greater than

1783
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:41,184
Sphinx because it's not a monument to the Dead

1784
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:44,000
This is a monument to the living

1785
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:45,280
The damn is alive

1786
01:39:45,792 --> 01:39:46,560
And I know it gives

1787
01:39:47,328 --> 01:39:49,120
I had to stop and throw up the do

1788
01:39:49,632 --> 01:39:51,424
Wow look at that

1789
01:39:51,936 --> 01:39:53,984
Even a a damn hater

1790
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:55,264
Astrid

1791
01:39:56,544 --> 01:39:58,080
I was tremendously impressed

1792
01:39:58,592 --> 01:39:59,360
By that damn

1793
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:06,016
When I first laid eyes on it I felt like I had to get out of my car and kneel down in genuflect those engineers

1794
01:40:06,272 --> 01:40:09,344
I built something not just immense but really

1795
01:40:10,624 --> 01:40:11,136
Beautiful

1796
01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:16,768
53 million dollar bowl today I'm highest in the world is practically

1797
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:23,424
All but a few of the remaining workers get their final paychecks from the stupendous day

1798
01:40:25,216 --> 01:40:28,800
And ahead of schedule and the depth of a great drought

1799
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:30,336
And the Great Depression

1800
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:35,200
Hoover Dam held

1801
01:40:35,456 --> 01:40:41,344
2 years of the Colorado's flow in a 100-mile reservoir so heavy it bent the Earth

1802
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:44,416
Across creating its own tiny earthquakes

1803
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:51,584
In the name of people of the United

1804
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:55,424
Go home you bowled Adam

1805
01:40:55,936 --> 01:40:58,752
All right symbol of greater things in the future

1806
01:40:59,776 --> 01:41:01,568
And in the honored Pres

1807
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:04,128
From many

1808
01:41:05,152 --> 01:41:06,688
I call you

1809
01:41:06,944 --> 01:41:07,456
Don't

1810
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:24,608
Who was the greatest single source of electricity in the world

1811
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:28,448
It's turbines with power the aircraft industry that help

1812
01:41:28,704 --> 01:41:29,472
To defeat Hitler

1813
01:41:29,728 --> 01:41:33,056
Would Light Up Downtown Los Angeles and a hundred other cities

1814
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:37,664
It's water with irrigate thousands of funds in California

1815
01:41:38,432 --> 01:41:44,576
Hoover Dam proved it could be done it gave me the confidence to damn the

1816
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:50,976
It also gave them confidence to plan dams for

1817
01:41:51,232 --> 01:41:52,768
Every single River in America

1818
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:55,328
If anybody comes

1819
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:56,352
In the

1820
01:41:56,864 --> 01:42:03,008
Several thousand years from outer space and they land there they will know exactly what happened

1821
01:42:03,264 --> 01:42:06,080
On this spot at that time just by reading the Stars

1822
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:11,200
On the edge of Hoover Dam is a mosaic star map

1823
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:17,088
It shows the alignment of planets and stars in the heavens on September 30th 1935

1824
01:42:17,344 --> 01:42:18,880
The day the dam was dedicated

1825
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:21,952
It was designed to

1826
01:42:22,464 --> 01:42:23,488
Thousands of years

1827
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:26,560
Anybody

1828
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:29,888
Anas

1829
01:42:32,192 --> 01:42:33,472
More than anything else

1830
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:35,264
Hoover convinced

1831
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:38,592
We could conquer the Fatal dryness of the Great American Des

1832
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:41,664
I didn't really appreciate

1833
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:44,224
What this place was all about at 10:00 at night

1834
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:45,760
I woke up in the morning

1835
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:47,040
And I opened the blinds

1836
01:42:47,296 --> 01:42:49,088
And all I saw was Baron desert

1837
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:52,416
And I thought I'd landed on the moon

1838
01:42:52,672 --> 01:42:55,488
Who live in Arizona say that they love the desert

1839
01:42:57,536 --> 01:42:59,584
From the perspective of the air conditioned home

1840
01:43:00,096 --> 01:43:02,656
If you talk to the frontier the pioneer

1841
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:04,192
Is that wandered across it

1842
01:43:04,704 --> 01:43:05,984
Trying to get some place

1843
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:08,288
Where they could live where they could sustain themselves

1844
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:12,384
It was the most terrifying experience imaginable

1845
01:43:13,152 --> 01:43:14,432
Many people died

1846
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:15,712
Crossing the great BAS

1847
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:17,504
That immigrant Trail is

1848
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:19,040
Littered with

1849
01:43:19,552 --> 01:43:20,832
Everybody thinks about the Donner

1850
01:43:21,344 --> 01:43:22,368
And how they died in the snow

1851
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:23,904
But

1852
01:43:24,672 --> 01:43:25,184
People died

1853
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:25,952
In the

1854
01:43:28,256 --> 01:43:31,584
When power first warned against oversettling the Arid West

1855
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:33,376
Other scientists argued that

1856
01:43:33,888 --> 01:43:35,168
Rain would follow the pl

1857
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:38,240
But plowing and planting would agitate the air

1858
01:43:38,496 --> 01:43:41,056
Cause clouds to form and Rain to fall

1859
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:49,504
The frustration of trying to convince the Congress

1860
01:43:51,808 --> 01:43:52,320
That the

1861
01:43:52,576 --> 01:43:53,856
Just couldn't sustain

1862
01:43:54,368 --> 01:43:55,904
The level of population

1863
01:43:58,976 --> 01:44:00,768
Wanted to impose on the region

1864
01:44:01,024 --> 01:44:03,584
When they were trying to pound a square peg into a round hole

1865
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:06,144
Pioneers went

1866
01:44:06,656 --> 01:44:11,520
The first thing that had to be done was to banish the idea that this was in any sense of Des

1867
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:13,056
Please

1868
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:14,080
Pioneers

1869
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:20,480
Had no idea how dry it was out there they were going into a region that couldn't be farmed without irrig

1870
01:44:20,992 --> 01:44:21,760
And nobody

1871
01:44:22,016 --> 01:44:23,552
Was talking about irrigation

1872
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:28,672
Throw corn or squash and melons a beans

1873
01:44:28,928 --> 01:44:34,560
I guess naturally we just learn how to use the water conservative list because we never had any water we live in

1874
01:44:34,816 --> 01:44:40,960
Eric Lynn you know we're just you don't irrigate any of that no no rain

1875
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:45,824
The hopes have lived near the Colorado for a thousand years

1876
01:44:46,848 --> 01:44:52,992
On the heels of our Triumph at Hoover came a time in American history

1877
01:44:53,248 --> 01:44:56,576
Pray when we had the money and resolved to build on a grand scale

1878
01:44:57,088 --> 01:44:58,880
To subdue the rivers of the West

1879
01:44:59,136 --> 01:45:00,672
And to make them do our bidding

1880
01:45:02,208 --> 01:45:06,048
The original Mission of the beer Reclamation to reclaim the Arid West

1881
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:10,144
Was was a calling that had some real Vision to it

1882
01:45:11,168 --> 01:45:14,752
In 1933 there was a stamp

1883
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:16,032
Said conservation

1884
01:45:16,544 --> 01:45:17,056
Who is

1885
01:45:17,824 --> 01:45:18,848
End of the picture of a damn

1886
01:45:19,872 --> 01:45:21,152
So that was consolation then

1887
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:25,760
So there is this great big rash to see how many dams we could build in this

1888
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:28,320
No matter what the consequences would be later

1889
01:45:28,576 --> 01:45:29,344
The impact

1890
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:34,976
That large store mainstream storage reservoirs had on salmon and other fishery resources

1891
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:37,280
With something that was recogn

1892
01:45:38,048 --> 01:45:38,816
And then dismiss

1893
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:40,352
That was the cost that was

1894
01:45:40,608 --> 01:45:42,144
Price that one paid for development

1895
01:45:55,200 --> 01:46:00,576
Finishing salmon for the vanishing Redmond winter food for the TR

1896
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:12,864
Hydroelectric dams flood control dams irrigation dams in

1897
01:46:18,752 --> 01:46:22,848
Even plans to reroute the Colombia a thousand miles south

1898
01:46:23,104 --> 01:46:24,128
Into the Colorado

1899
01:46:24,896 --> 01:46:30,528
Before computers environmental impact studies or federal deficits

1900
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:36,928
We built a thousand major dams over the next 30 years we

1901
01:46:37,184 --> 01:46:43,328
Virginia dryness out of existence

1902
01:46:43,584 --> 01:46:47,680
Grand Coulee and then we were building the five largest

1903
01:46:47,936 --> 01:46:48,704
Structures on

1904
01:46:49,728 --> 01:46:50,752
Simultane

1905
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:53,312
All in one region of one country

1906
01:46:54,080 --> 01:47:00,224
Long Colombia roll alone

1907
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:04,320
After Hoover return to the Columbia

1908
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:06,624
Greatest Salmon River in the world

1909
01:47:08,928 --> 01:47:10,208
My 1955

1910
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:16,608
55 dams on the Columbia and its tributaries

1911
01:47:21,472 --> 01:47:21,984
That

1912
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:24,544
Engineers who worked on Hoover went up there

1913
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,080
And looked at that can

1914
01:47:26,336 --> 01:47:29,152
And imagine this damn 4/5 of a mile wide

1915
01:47:29,408 --> 01:47:30,944
And 550 ft

1916
01:47:31,712 --> 01:47:33,504
They said it made Hoover look like nothing

1917
01:47:34,016 --> 01:47:40,160
Ethiopia on a whirlwind US tour he expresses the hope that such a damn might be

1918
01:47:46,816 --> 01:47:52,448
And almost no stretch of the Colombia was not a reservoir

1919
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:56,544
There was unfinished business on the Colorado

1920
01:47:57,056 --> 01:47:57,824
The 19

1921
01:47:58,080 --> 01:48:04,224
Twenties that came down in here and actually did a full trip through the Grand Canyon and identify a whole series of dams that

1922
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:06,528
Essentially would have backed up the Colorado River

1923
01:48:06,784 --> 01:48:12,928
In a series of stair step reservoirs all the way from the Mexico United States line all the way up into Wyoming

1924
01:48:13,184 --> 01:48:13,952
Coming in Colorado

1925
01:48:16,512 --> 01:48:19,072
The bureau began work on the dam in Glen Canyon

1926
01:48:19,584 --> 01:48:21,888
It would generate hydropower for Phoenix

1927
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:28,288
And revenue to pay for other dams and would submerge 186 miles of Canyon

1928
01:48:29,568 --> 01:48:31,104
The Big Dam in the Colorado River

1929
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:36,992
They went in the big capacity would be playing the Canyon Dam the 26 million acre foot capacity Reser

1930
01:48:37,248 --> 01:48:38,784
186 Mi long

1931
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:40,832
That was the big one that was the money maker

1932
01:48:41,344 --> 01:48:44,160
It wasn't for irrigation it was just to make hydroelectric power

1933
01:48:44,672 --> 01:48:50,816
Grand Canyon was one of the most remote spots in America a hundred miles from the nearest

1934
01:48:51,072 --> 01:48:51,840
Paid Road

1935
01:48:52,352 --> 01:48:54,912
Hair Powell found the river smooth and

1936
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:57,728
With Anasazi ruins on the banks

1937
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:02,336
Barely 200 people had ever been through the canyon

1938
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:08,224
The first year I ran down Glen Canyon was in 1954

1939
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:14,624
And as we come near Lees Ferry probably 15 or so miles above Lees Ferry

1940
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:20,512
There's marks on the wall there's something going on over there there's piles of dirt I looked up

1941
01:49:20,768 --> 01:49:21,536
We did

1942
01:49:21,792 --> 01:49:23,840
There are 600 or more feet above

1943
01:49:24,608 --> 01:49:27,936
You dot little guys wave on top of the rim

1944
01:49:28,448 --> 01:49:29,984
We look through the binoculars and

1945
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:36,640
Damn this Canyon

1946
01:49:37,152 --> 01:49:40,480
Glen Canyon as it was

1947
01:49:41,504 --> 01:49:47,648
Glen Canyon as it will be at 11:30

1948
01:49:47,904 --> 01:49:48,928
1956

1949
01:50:07,872 --> 01:50:11,456
I marveled

1950
01:50:11,712 --> 01:50:14,528
Because here was a sheer wall

1951
01:50:14,784 --> 01:50:15,552
Canyon

1952
01:50:16,064 --> 01:50:17,344
Muddy river running through it

1953
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:18,624
And

1954
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:20,160
I tried to visualize

1955
01:50:20,416 --> 01:50:21,952
Hoover Dam already in

1956
01:50:22,464 --> 01:50:25,024
That was what we were doing we were building a duplicate of Hoover

1957
01:50:26,048 --> 01:50:26,560
Stag

1958
01:50:26,816 --> 01:50:27,328
Me

1959
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:29,120
To think of the job

1960
01:50:29,376 --> 01:50:29,888
But to be done

1961
01:50:30,656 --> 01:50:33,984
Reclamation Chief was the legendary Floyd Domini

1962
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:38,592
Floyd domini is a household world in the 17 Western

1963
01:50:39,104 --> 01:50:40,128
The reclamation

1964
01:50:40,896 --> 01:50:43,200
Kennedy called me the nation's Waterboy

1965
01:50:44,736 --> 01:50:47,808
Senator Jackson at prevailed on Udall to suggest

1966
01:50:48,064 --> 01:50:49,088
Maybe it was time for me to

1967
01:50:49,344 --> 01:50:49,856
Retire

1968
01:50:50,368 --> 01:50:51,136
All I had to do was

1969
01:50:51,392 --> 01:50:52,416
Wish alert the White House

1970
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:54,720
That these people

1971
01:50:54,976 --> 01:50:56,000
Twisted my tail

1972
01:50:56,256 --> 01:50:58,048
And pinching a little and

1973
01:50:58,560 --> 01:50:59,072
Just

1974
01:50:59,328 --> 01:50:59,840
Took care of it

1975
01:51:00,864 --> 01:51:07,008
He's sort of the the role model for a lot of of ways that the bureau approach things it was more of a

1976
01:51:07,264 --> 01:51:10,848
Turn the Torpedoes let's get this son of a b**** built

1977
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:13,408
He got a lot of it built

1978
01:51:14,176 --> 01:51:18,272
I remember that the hydroelectric energy is the only

1979
01:51:18,784 --> 01:51:20,576
Pollution free energy

1980
01:51:20,832 --> 01:51:23,392
It's created it's renewable

1981
01:51:23,648 --> 01:51:26,208
You don't burn

1982
01:51:26,464 --> 01:51:29,792
Coal mine and you don't mind out of mind you don't drill out a well

1983
01:51:30,048 --> 01:51:36,192
You don't have 25,000 year half life full of rods from the atomic power

1984
01:51:36,448 --> 01:51:42,592
I think it's a shame that we haven't developed

1985
01:51:42,848 --> 01:51:44,128
Every single

1986
01:51:44,384 --> 01:51:45,408
Possible Kil

1987
01:51:45,664 --> 01:51:48,992
A lot from this renewable non-politan source of energy

1988
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:55,904
Everyone in the in the great Reclamation including Western

1989
01:51:56,160 --> 01:52:01,024
Firmly believe that the Reclamation program was a must

1990
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:05,376
For the girls and expansion of the West and we had no descend

1991
01:52:05,888 --> 01:52:07,168
Swim in the 40s and

1992
01:52:07,424 --> 01:52:08,960
Early 50s at least

1993
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:15,104
The great moment

1994
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:16,384
Damn Construction

1995
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:23,040
Is when you finally realize that if you put the last bucket of concrete on the top of the dam and that

1996
01:52:23,296 --> 01:52:24,320
Now are prepared to

1997
01:52:24,576 --> 01:52:25,344
Close the tun

1998
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:27,648
And let the River start

1999
01:52:27,904 --> 01:52:28,928
Making its way up

2000
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:30,976
To the spillway levels

2001
01:52:31,744 --> 01:52:33,024
And and feel the lake

2002
01:52:33,792 --> 01:52:36,096
When Glen Canyon Dam was nearly complete

2003
01:52:36,352 --> 01:52:39,680
David Brower executive director of the Sierra Club

2004
01:52:39,936 --> 01:52:43,264
Visited The Condemned Canyons for the first time

2005
01:52:44,032 --> 01:52:47,360
Brower and the Sierra Club had stopped a dam on the Green River

2006
01:52:47,872 --> 01:52:50,944
In exchange for not objecting to the dam in Glen Canyon

2007
01:52:52,224 --> 01:52:54,784
Grand Canyon used to be filled with beaver

2008
01:52:55,296 --> 01:52:57,344
And no beaver in there anymore

2009
01:52:57,856 --> 01:52:59,904
A good fishing in there

2010
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:01,440
It was just a

2011
01:53:01,952 --> 01:53:02,464
Quiet

2012
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:03,488
No Rabb

2013
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:04,512
To speak of

2014
01:53:04,768 --> 01:53:07,840
Has a very historic spots in there just

2015
01:53:08,096 --> 01:53:13,472
Nice place

2016
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:16,800
Each one of them with a stream in it

2017
01:53:18,336 --> 01:53:21,152
Would you walk up this little stream then you turn left

2018
01:53:21,408 --> 01:53:24,480
And suddenly you're in one of the most remarkable designers

2019
01:53:24,992 --> 01:53:26,272
Huge Amphitheater

2020
01:53:27,296 --> 01:53:29,344
A much bigger than most of the casinos I've been in

2021
01:53:29,856 --> 01:53:31,392
Just a little slot of sky

2022
01:53:32,672 --> 01:53:34,464
A little bit of water coming over a waterfall

2023
01:53:34,976 --> 01:53:35,744
At the head of

2024
01:53:37,024 --> 01:53:38,048
Up to

2025
01:53:38,816 --> 01:53:39,840
A lot of

2026
01:53:40,096 --> 01:53:42,144
Smooth sandstone

2027
01:53:43,168 --> 01:53:45,216
If you touched it it just felt like velvet

2028
01:53:46,496 --> 01:53:47,520
And above that

2029
01:53:48,032 --> 01:53:49,312
Twisting funnel

2030
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:51,360
Where the light came down

2031
01:53:52,896 --> 01:53:54,176
Kind of yellow

2032
01:53:54,432 --> 01:53:58,272
Then kind of dimmer and dimmer and then kind of Orange

2033
01:53:58,784 --> 01:53:59,808
An Exquisite place

2034
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:03,648
Just about as beautiful as anything the Creator ever dreamed

2035
01:54:04,928 --> 01:54:06,208
Powell had been the first

2036
01:54:06,464 --> 01:54:08,768
First Outsider to see Glen Canyon

2037
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:11,328
And these dozens of side Canyons

2038
01:54:12,352 --> 01:54:12,864
Brower

2039
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:14,144
Would be one of the last

2040
01:54:14,912 --> 01:54:16,704
And a Grand Canyon this was a crit

2041
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:17,472
Pickle Time

2042
01:54:17,728 --> 01:54:20,288
And I recall the decision I had to make

2043
01:54:20,544 --> 01:54:22,080
Whether we could close the

2044
01:54:24,384 --> 01:54:26,688
That year or have to wait another year

2045
01:54:27,456 --> 01:54:32,320
I've seen again and I'd seen the side again as my family had seen in my new but a beautiful place it was

2046
01:54:33,088 --> 01:54:34,112
I testified in

2047
01:54:34,368 --> 01:54:38,208
Lack of comprehensive thinking that is going under the entire project and came up with

2048
01:54:38,464 --> 01:54:41,536
Very strong Arguments for stopping the entire project

2049
01:54:42,048 --> 01:54:43,840
I wanted at least at the last moment

2050
01:54:44,352 --> 01:54:46,144
To appeal to Steward you doll

2051
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:51,008
And I wanted to get in to talk to him because that was the last day they were going to close the

2052
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:55,872
And start feeling Glen Canyon and I got to his office but never got to see him because he

2053
01:54:56,384 --> 01:54:57,664
He had this other agenda

2054
01:54:57,920 --> 01:54:58,944
Of course all the upper

2055
01:54:59,200 --> 01:55:03,040
States people and politicians were saying close the gates

2056
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:08,416
And all the downstream people who relied on the water coming on through

2057
01:55:09,184 --> 01:55:10,720
Don't close

2058
01:55:12,256 --> 01:55:14,304
Hi I didn't have this last desperate hope

2059
01:55:15,328 --> 01:55:16,096
And we could

2060
01:55:16,608 --> 01:55:19,424
They the closing of the day on the closing of the river valves

2061
01:55:19,936 --> 01:55:21,216
Stop any further filling

2062
01:55:21,984 --> 01:55:24,800
Until we thought a little bit harder about the alternatives

2063
01:55:25,312 --> 01:55:26,336
And that January

2064
01:55:26,848 --> 01:55:27,616
63

2065
01:55:27,872 --> 01:55:28,384
I fail

2066
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:30,432
So Ben Canyon started filling

2067
01:55:31,456 --> 01:55:33,760
We finally got an estim

2068
01:55:34,016 --> 01:55:38,368
That indicated and that we would get up to power plant intake levels

2069
01:55:38,624 --> 01:55:40,160
By the end of July

2070
01:55:40,928 --> 01:55:42,720
And so I made the recommend

2071
01:55:43,232 --> 01:55:44,512
That we closed the

2072
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:45,792
And

2073
01:55:47,072 --> 01:55:53,216
But I was the one person it was the skin position

2074
01:55:54,496 --> 01:55:56,544
And there's where my big failure was

2075
01:55:57,056 --> 01:55:57,824
We had the AR

2076
01:55:58,336 --> 01:55:59,104
We had the votes

2077
01:56:00,384 --> 01:56:04,736
And for reasons that I still do not understand I didn't do what I should have done

2078
01:56:04,992 --> 01:56:05,504
I

2079
01:56:06,784 --> 01:56:12,928
And I didn't act

2080
01:56:13,184 --> 01:56:14,720
Shut it down into the

2081
01:56:14,976 --> 01:56:18,816
Canyon landscape I can see from afar

2082
01:56:19,072 --> 01:56:20,352
It's plugging the river

2083
01:56:20,864 --> 01:56:23,424
The place where Glen Canyon Dam stand

2084
01:56:24,192 --> 01:56:27,776
As I look around at this incredibly beautiful and creative work

2085
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:32,896
Of writing on the wall

2086
01:56:34,176 --> 01:56:35,712
A kind that says

2087
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:38,016
Probably and beautifully

2088
01:56:39,296 --> 01:56:41,344
Man was here

2089
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:47,744
We're looking down $583 ft or 175 m

2090
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,792
Goodbye hat

2091
01:56:50,048 --> 01:56:56,192
The reservoir was christened 100 years to the day after power passed through Glen Canyon

2092
01:56:58,240 --> 01:57:04,384
Glen Canyon Dam was built to generate hydropower for homes industry and air conditioning

2093
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:05,152
In Phoenix

2094
01:57:05,664 --> 01:57:10,016
And to power pumps which lift the Colorado 300 miles uphill

2095
01:57:10,272 --> 01:57:12,320
To new farms and towns in Arizona

2096
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:15,648
Today

2097
01:57:15,904 --> 01:57:19,744
4 million people a year visit Glen Canyon Dam and its Lake

2098
01:57:21,792 --> 01:57:23,328
But I felt from the very start

2099
01:57:23,584 --> 01:57:25,120
Should be like Paul because

2100
01:57:25,376 --> 01:57:28,192
Paul is the man who had made the canyon famous

2101
01:57:28,448 --> 01:57:34,592
He was the man who was treated the father of the Bureau of Reclamation he was the one who made the reports to Congress that indicated

2102
01:57:34,848 --> 01:57:38,944
Addicted the West could never be developed by private Enterprise alone and it would take

2103
01:57:39,456 --> 01:57:43,040
The power and muscle of the federal government to develop and settle the

2104
01:57:43,296 --> 01:57:43,808
Properly

2105
01:57:44,832 --> 01:57:47,648
So I thought Lake Powell was the proper name for that res

2106
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:50,208
One of the most outrageous things that ever happened

2107
01:57:50,976 --> 01:57:53,792
Question name the reservoir the Flatwater

2108
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:57,632
Behind Glen Canyon Dam after John Wesley Powell

2109
01:57:58,144 --> 01:58:02,240
Reservoir that flooded some things that he thought were the most beautifully he had ever seen

2110
01:58:02,752 --> 01:58:03,264
I'm sure

2111
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:04,544
If you're around

2112
01:58:05,056 --> 01:58:08,896
He would be after the person who thought of that idea and you say you can't do that

2113
01:58:09,664 --> 01:58:12,224
Maybe Dominique's Flatwater or something

2114
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:13,248
Lake pow

2115
01:58:14,016 --> 01:58:16,832
When you damn a river you always lose

2116
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:18,112
You

2117
01:58:19,136 --> 01:58:19,904
Prov

2118
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:21,952
Something for somebody else

2119
01:58:22,976 --> 01:58:25,792
And I have somebody in the middle get upset

2120
01:58:26,816 --> 01:58:30,400
Extended a Goldwater had been a strong advocate for Glen Canyon Dam

2121
01:58:31,936 --> 01:58:35,264
Prayer soon I guess probably one of the most beautiful reservoirs in the world

2122
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:38,592
And as you write on it you can see things you could not have seen in the river

2123
01:58:38,848 --> 01:58:40,640
But I just assume I never see them

2124
01:58:41,664 --> 01:58:44,224
Left Bank

2125
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:46,784
And I wound around I came across

2126
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:48,832
A very narrow place

2127
01:58:49,088 --> 01:58:52,160
I could just barely get my boat through and I looked back

2128
01:58:52,672 --> 01:58:55,488
Down and the Sun at that particular moment

2129
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:59,072
Had come down just like a beam right

2130
01:58:59,328 --> 01:59:00,864
Back down into the water

2131
01:59:01,376 --> 01:59:02,912
And what it showed me

2132
01:59:04,192 --> 01:59:09,056
Spirals that I had looked up at

2133
01:59:09,312 --> 01:59:12,128
They're 2000 Anasazi

2134
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:14,176
Buried in the water now

2135
01:59:14,944 --> 01:59:21,088
But they decided to practice Advantage was without way that this was a controversial damn it kicked off the environment

2136
01:59:21,344 --> 01:59:22,624
Mentalist movement in the United States

2137
01:59:23,136 --> 01:59:28,768
Because a handful of people had taken the trouble to find out what an Exquisite little canyon this was

2138
01:59:55,904 --> 02:00:01,792
These Canyons now lie 600 ft below the surface of Lake Powell

2139
02:00:07,168 --> 02:00:10,496
But I have to be honest with you I've been happier

2140
02:00:10,752 --> 02:00:12,032
If we didn't have the lake

2141
02:00:14,848 --> 02:00:15,872
Piece of water

2142
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:17,664
If you had to vote

2143
02:00:18,176 --> 02:00:18,688
Today

2144
02:00:19,456 --> 02:00:22,528
On damn in Glen Canyon would you vote against it

2145
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:26,368
Cuz I

2146
02:00:27,136 --> 02:00:28,416
I've become convinced

2147
02:00:30,464 --> 02:00:31,744
Well water is important

2148
02:00:32,512 --> 02:00:35,328
Particular those of us who live in the desert

2149
02:00:35,584 --> 02:00:37,120
It's not all that important

2150
02:00:37,632 --> 02:00:43,008
8 million years of geolog

2151
02:00:43,264 --> 02:00:45,056
To change came to a sudden end

2152
02:00:45,568 --> 02:00:46,848
Environmental hav

2153
02:00:47,104 --> 02:00:48,640
Swiftly took hold Downstream

2154
02:00:50,176 --> 02:00:54,528
For years the Colorado had run 85° and Rich with silk

2155
02:00:58,112 --> 02:01:00,928
It runs freezing cold and Crystal Clear

2156
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:05,024
Most of the Native fish

2157
02:01:05,536 --> 02:01:08,864
Which had evolved over a million years in the warm salty water

2158
02:01:09,888 --> 02:01:11,424
Into Extinction

2159
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:16,032
Lake Powell evaporates 10 ft a year

2160
02:01:19,616 --> 02:01:25,760
The Violet natural floods which redistributed River Sands were replaced by

2161
02:01:27,552 --> 02:01:29,088
Govern not by the rain

2162
02:01:29,344 --> 02:01:29,856
Goodbye

2163
02:01:30,112 --> 02:01:31,648
Power demand in Phoenix

2164
02:01:32,672 --> 02:01:38,816
Would you believe a fish story in which a transport plane is

2165
02:01:58,272 --> 02:02:04,416
I had no sympathy for those who felt that nature couldn't

2166
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:06,208
No I ad

2167
02:02:06,464 --> 02:02:09,280
The picture can improve upon man we're probably

2168
02:02:09,536 --> 02:02:10,304
Supreme Being but

2169
02:02:12,096 --> 02:02:14,144
In the realm of river

2170
02:02:15,680 --> 02:02:16,192
I think

2171
02:02:16,704 --> 02:02:17,984
Man can improve up

2172
02:02:18,496 --> 02:02:24,640
We're not trying to recreate what was here before the dam that's kind of I mean it's almost impossible to do but

2173
02:02:24,896 --> 02:02:31,040
Still trying to protect the endangered species 40 years ago there were no studies of the environmental change Glen Canyon Dam

2174
02:02:31,296 --> 02:02:32,064
Set in motion

2175
02:02:32,832 --> 02:02:34,880
National Environmental laws did not exist

2176
02:02:35,648 --> 02:02:36,160
Now

2177
02:02:36,416 --> 02:02:38,720
A bureau team studies those changes in the river

2178
02:02:38,976 --> 02:02:39,488
System

2179
02:02:40,512 --> 02:02:44,352
Towels men found the ancient river half a mile wide at its mouth

2180
02:02:44,864 --> 02:02:46,144
Pouring into the ocean

2181
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:49,216
By 1967

2182
02:02:49,472 --> 02:02:50,240
Hoover

2183
02:02:50,496 --> 02:02:51,520
Glen Canyon

2184
02:02:51,776 --> 02:02:55,360
And eight of the damn stop the river in a chain of giant reservoirs

2185
02:02:56,384 --> 02:02:58,432
Accepting very wet years

2186
02:02:58,688 --> 02:03:04,832
The Colorado River no longer reaches the sea the remains of the river vanished into the sand

2187
02:03:05,088 --> 02:03:11,232
In Northern Neck many many people have had lives and livelihoods

2188
02:03:11,488 --> 02:03:17,632
Cities have been built and huge amounts of food produced that just would never have happened without

2189
02:03:17,888 --> 02:03:23,520
About these Reclamation projects and I don't think anyone can truly logically sit down and say in the grand scope

2190
02:03:23,776 --> 02:03:26,336
Of everything in context that that was an evil thing to do

2191
02:03:26,592 --> 02:03:29,152
We believe that this is where we emerg

2192
02:03:30,176 --> 02:03:31,456
Cuz this is what we call

2193
02:03:31,712 --> 02:03:32,736
The center of the

2194
02:03:33,504 --> 02:03:34,528
Grand Canyon

2195
02:03:35,296 --> 02:03:36,576
Is one of the most sacred

2196
02:03:36,832 --> 02:03:37,344
Place

2197
02:03:38,112 --> 02:03:40,928
In the universe as far as I hope he's as concerned

2198
02:03:41,184 --> 02:03:42,208
Very important

2199
02:03:42,464 --> 02:03:43,744
Plus we don't want to destroy this

2200
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,816
I know somebody mentioned it yesterday you're trying to play

2201
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:48,864
Well I don't know

2202
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:51,424
I don't think we are able to do that

2203
02:03:51,680 --> 02:03:53,216
Because we're human who are moral be

2204
02:03:53,984 --> 02:03:55,776
I know some of you are very very bright

2205
02:03:56,032 --> 02:03:56,544
Smart

2206
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:57,312
You know

2207
02:03:57,568 --> 02:03:59,104
I don't think you can go beyond

2208
02:04:00,384 --> 02:04:02,688
On behalf of air star helicopters at myself

2209
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:03,712
Like the

2210
02:04:04,224 --> 02:04:04,992
Grand

2211
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:11,904
Avenue of all the Lady Gaga

2212
02:04:15,744 --> 02:04:17,792
The Colorado River flows down the canyon

2213
02:04:19,072 --> 02:04:21,120
They come together right in front of us at a place called

2214
02:04:21,376 --> 02:04:21,888
Confer

2215
02:04:22,144 --> 02:04:25,984
To the Hopi

2216
02:04:26,240 --> 02:04:29,056
The Confluence of the Colorado and the little Colorado

2217
02:04:29,312 --> 02:04:33,152
Marks the place where humans first emerged from the earth 8 years ago

2218
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:37,760
Antenna I guess 9 million years old

2219
02:04:38,528 --> 02:04:40,576
You take a ballpoint pen and just draw a

2220
02:04:41,856 --> 02:04:43,904
Just a piece of paper that's the game out of Eros

2221
02:04:44,416 --> 02:04:46,464
The truck every year for 9 million years

2222
02:04:46,976 --> 02:04:48,000
To make the grand can

2223
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:51,584
On the very day Glen Canyon began to fill

2224
02:04:52,096 --> 02:04:55,680
The Bureau announced plans for more power dams on the Colorado

2225
02:04:55,936 --> 02:04:57,728
Including one and Marvel can

2226
02:04:57,984 --> 02:04:59,520
Not far from the confluence

2227
02:05:00,544 --> 02:05:03,360
Was a wonderful damn

2228
02:05:04,384 --> 02:05:05,920
Sure Canyon walls over

2229
02:05:06,944 --> 02:05:10,272
Straight up and down it's just near perpendicular as you could get

2230
02:05:10,528 --> 02:05:11,296
And a very Nar

2231
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:12,832
So it was a

2232
02:05:13,088 --> 02:05:13,600
Perfect damn

2233
02:05:15,136 --> 02:05:17,696
Come over Gorge is a remarkable

2234
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:19,488
In Colorado

2235
02:05:19,744 --> 02:05:20,768
French and trenches

2236
02:05:21,024 --> 02:05:23,072
Very deep in their very steep wall

2237
02:05:23,328 --> 02:05:24,352
There are places where the

2238
02:05:24,864 --> 02:05:26,656
The river is polished that marble

2239
02:05:26,912 --> 02:05:27,424
Glor

2240
02:05:27,680 --> 02:05:30,752
Are you have internet and are well into the red wall

2241
02:05:31,008 --> 02:05:32,032
Stone formation

2242
02:05:32,544 --> 02:05:34,592
Place they finally decided to build

2243
02:05:34,848 --> 02:05:36,384
The so-called marble dance

2244
02:05:37,152 --> 02:05:40,224
And they had a big operation there the regular Community was

2245
02:05:40,736 --> 02:05:42,272
Performed in the vicinity

2246
02:05:42,528 --> 02:05:43,296
They had a

2247
02:05:43,808 --> 02:05:48,928
An aerial Tramway that came down from the Canyon Rim they had to test the Rock

2248
02:05:49,184 --> 02:05:50,464
In order to do that they

2249
02:05:53,024 --> 02:05:59,168
So they began testing the cliffs there they Rock for its strengths

2250
02:05:59,424 --> 02:06:05,056
These new dams would flood 140 miles of Canyon between Hoover and Glen

2251
02:06:05,312 --> 02:06:09,664
They were the centerpiece of an immense plan to generate more power for growing cities

2252
02:06:11,200 --> 02:06:11,968
Having

2253
02:06:12,224 --> 02:06:12,992
Glen Canyon

2254
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:17,088
And realizing how great a loss that was for all time

2255
02:06:17,600 --> 02:06:20,672
Hey I've just had a new determination with let's not do it

2256
02:06:20,928 --> 02:06:21,440
Anymore

2257
02:06:21,696 --> 02:06:23,232
And certainly not the grand

2258
02:06:24,256 --> 02:06:27,072
So we began to do what we could do to block the ATT

2259
02:06:27,328 --> 02:06:29,888
Cuz if you're a Reclamation to build a two Grand Canyon Dam

2260
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:31,680
Now a big smile

2261
02:06:31,936 --> 02:06:36,544
The Grand Canyon is so deep that tourists on the rim cannot see the river

2262
02:06:40,128 --> 02:06:42,176
Broward testified before Congress

2263
02:06:42,432 --> 02:06:43,712
At the dams would be wasteful

2264
02:06:44,224 --> 02:06:44,992
An impractical

2265
02:06:46,016 --> 02:06:51,392
This is big questionable wouldn't you compromise wouldn't you take just a little teeny weenie down the Grand Canyon

2266
02:06:51,648 --> 02:06:54,464
And I said no the Grand Canyon wasn't lying to trade

2267
02:06:54,976 --> 02:06:55,488
Permanent

2268
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:56,512
Mass

2269
02:06:57,536 --> 02:06:58,816
It would have altered it forever

2270
02:06:59,584 --> 02:07:00,608
So we had to stop

2271
02:07:01,120 --> 02:07:01,888
And it wasn't easy

2272
02:07:04,192 --> 02:07:08,544
They didn't want any dams build any place on the Colorado River

2273
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:11,104
It's not hard for me to understand that

2274
02:07:14,688 --> 02:07:15,712
Of Arizona voters

2275
02:07:16,992 --> 02:07:17,760
I don't like to

2276
02:07:18,016 --> 02:07:20,832
To see these dams built I wish there were some way we didn't have to

2277
02:07:21,088 --> 02:07:21,600
Have to build them

2278
02:07:22,112 --> 02:07:25,184
But speaking for people who are mounting by the mill

2279
02:07:25,696 --> 02:07:29,792
And I expect to live to see the day when my city will be the 5th or sixth Lar

2280
02:07:30,048 --> 02:07:30,816
Just in America

2281
02:07:31,328 --> 02:07:33,120
I have to argue for these people

2282
02:07:34,144 --> 02:07:39,264
Commissioner domini pointed out that reservoirs would not be seen from any Vista point on the Canyon Rim

2283
02:07:40,032 --> 02:07:42,336
And that Marble Canyon filled with water

2284
02:07:42,592 --> 02:07:44,896
Would be more accessible to tourists and Power

2285
02:07:46,688 --> 02:07:49,504
Should we flood the Sistine Chapel so tourist

2286
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:51,040
Can get closer to the ceiling

2287
02:07:51,808 --> 02:07:53,344
How you know that was in response

2288
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:55,392
To the

2289
02:07:55,648 --> 02:07:58,208
Members of Congress from Arizona on all who said

2290
02:07:58,464 --> 02:08:02,048
We will make a beautiful Lake there so people can see the scenery better

2291
02:08:02,816 --> 02:08:05,632
So we ran ads in the New York Times the chronicle

2292
02:08:06,144 --> 02:08:08,192
Did Los Angeles Times Sacramento baby

2293
02:08:08,448 --> 02:08:09,984
Fan ads all over the Washington Post

2294
02:08:10,496 --> 02:08:11,520
Where we thought it would work

2295
02:08:12,032 --> 02:08:13,056
Americans

2296
02:08:13,312 --> 02:08:13,824
Tired

2297
02:08:14,336 --> 02:08:16,384
Have the idea that dams were conservation

2298
02:08:17,152 --> 02:08:21,248
The engineers argument that you can't place this water you can't let it flow to the Sea unus

2299
02:08:22,528 --> 02:08:23,296
Began to pay

2300
02:08:23,552 --> 02:08:25,856
I'm on the public so it was not that hard to say well

2301
02:08:26,368 --> 02:08:30,208
Consider that we have enough damage for an island to see if we can't keep some Rivers alive

2302
02:08:31,488 --> 02:08:35,584
The dams would rise like bookings on either side of Grand Canyon National Park

2303
02:08:36,096 --> 02:08:38,144
Technically outside the park boundary

2304
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:40,448
But Brower argued they would still

2305
02:08:40,704 --> 02:08:41,472
The Grand Canyon

2306
02:08:44,032 --> 02:08:47,360
I resent the fact that Dave Broward deliberately

2307
02:08:47,616 --> 02:08:48,896
I slept the public

2308
02:08:49,152 --> 02:08:50,688
About Bridge Canyon Dam

2309
02:08:50,944 --> 02:08:51,712
Play Domin

2310
02:08:51,968 --> 02:08:57,344
Are you still this day figured that the all I did was telling truth about what was going to happen to the Grand Canyon and

2311
02:08:57,600 --> 02:08:59,904
He gave the impression deliver

2312
02:09:01,184 --> 02:09:01,952
That we were

2313
02:09:02,208 --> 02:09:04,256
Flood the Grand Canyon National Park

2314
02:09:04,512 --> 02:09:05,792
There was actual tourist

2315
02:09:06,816 --> 02:09:08,864
Where would the lake be in this View

2316
02:09:09,376 --> 02:09:11,680
We use the Bureau of reclamations photograph

2317
02:09:12,448 --> 02:09:12,960
Of how

2318
02:09:13,472 --> 02:09:14,496
Would be inundated

2319
02:09:14,752 --> 02:09:17,312
It was an absolute lie and then brought knew it

2320
02:09:18,336 --> 02:09:21,408
So that sanctimonious bastard did he deliberately

2321
02:09:22,176 --> 02:09:23,968
We talked about damning the

2322
02:09:24,224 --> 02:09:24,736
Canyon

2323
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:26,784
That changed everything

2324
02:09:27,296 --> 02:09:28,320
The Grand Canyon

2325
02:09:28,832 --> 02:09:29,856
The reader's dig

2326
02:09:30,112 --> 02:09:31,136
Said it was a bad idea

2327
02:09:31,648 --> 02:09:33,184
My Weekly Reader

2328
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:34,464
Said it was a bad idea

2329
02:09:36,256 --> 02:09:36,768
And

2330
02:09:37,024 --> 02:09:38,560
The Beast was out of the bottle

2331
02:09:39,328 --> 02:09:40,352
I have no AP

2332
02:09:41,376 --> 02:09:42,400
I was

2333
02:09:42,656 --> 02:09:43,936
A crusader

2334
02:09:44,192 --> 02:09:45,216
For the development of

2335
02:09:46,240 --> 02:09:47,264
I was the mess

2336
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:48,288
I was the

2337
02:09:50,592 --> 02:09:53,152
It went out and and argued persu

2338
02:09:54,432 --> 02:09:56,992
After develop our rivers and and water

2339
02:09:57,248 --> 02:09:58,528
Supplies for the benefit of people

2340
02:10:00,576 --> 02:10:01,344
I don't apologize

2341
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:04,672
As public opinion swelled

2342
02:10:04,928 --> 02:10:07,744
Commissioner domini held out for at least one damn

2343
02:10:08,768 --> 02:10:10,560
We came very close to building that

2344
02:10:11,072 --> 02:10:11,840
Site was

2345
02:10:12,608 --> 02:10:14,912
The general feasibility studies were prepared

2346
02:10:15,168 --> 02:10:17,472
That damn was nearly a reality

2347
02:10:17,984 --> 02:10:19,520
I think the story goes

2348
02:10:19,776 --> 02:10:23,360
Once the Floyd domini went overseas on

2349
02:10:23,616 --> 02:10:26,432
An inspection and it wasn't until he left the country that

2350
02:10:26,944 --> 02:10:32,320
Are people that immediately hot old and and came to agreement not to include those struct

2351
02:10:32,576 --> 02:10:34,112
Pictures in the in the final legislation

2352
02:10:35,136 --> 02:10:35,648
The

2353
02:10:36,160 --> 02:10:36,928
We're taken out

2354
02:10:37,184 --> 02:10:38,464
Of the authorization bill

2355
02:10:38,720 --> 02:10:39,744
He had to be gone

2356
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:40,512
For that to

2357
02:10:42,048 --> 02:10:44,352
Was such a historic moment nobody knew it

2358
02:10:44,864 --> 02:10:46,144
The time but that really

2359
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:48,448
It was the beginning and it was a big beginning

2360
02:10:48,704 --> 02:10:50,496
Of the end of the age of Dance

2361
02:10:51,008 --> 02:10:54,336
We just come into what's called The Marble Canyon Dam Site Area

2362
02:10:54,592 --> 02:10:55,616
And in the

2363
02:10:55,872 --> 02:10:59,968
Late '50s early '60s this area was actually proposed

2364
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:01,760
For a damn

2365
02:11:02,016 --> 02:11:04,320
And this was one of the damn sites that was

2366
02:11:04,576 --> 02:11:05,856
Was being explored

2367
02:11:06,368 --> 02:11:12,256
There's added tunnels on both river right and River left and that's primarily where you see the mine tailings

2368
02:11:12,768 --> 02:11:16,608
On River Ridge you can see a couple of Bureau Reclamation graffiti signs

2369
02:11:17,632 --> 02:11:20,192
The one that's straight across from us is

2370
02:11:20,448 --> 02:11:22,752
The middle of the dam was to be located

2371
02:11:23,264 --> 02:11:26,848
A living river is a very exciting thing I should remain an exciting thing

2372
02:11:27,104 --> 02:11:30,432
Rivers done a very good job in the Grand Canyon has made a beautiful Canyon

2373
02:11:30,944 --> 02:11:33,760
And I'm not ready to penalize the river please a couple

2374
02:11:34,016 --> 02:11:35,552
Hydroelectric Engineers ever

2375
02:11:36,832 --> 02:11:38,368
Brower had one

2376
02:11:38,624 --> 02:11:41,952
Glen Canyon was the last Damn built on the Colorado

2377
02:11:42,976 --> 02:11:49,120
But saving Marble Canyon did not stop the flood of people drawn to new homes and new

2378
02:11:49,376 --> 02:11:50,144
Jobs in Arizona

2379
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:53,216
In 1969

2380
02:11:53,472 --> 02:11:55,008
Lyndon Johnson authorized

2381
02:11:55,264 --> 02:11:56,800
The central Arizona project

2382
02:11:58,336 --> 02:12:02,176
For the millions of Americans west of the Continental Divide

2383
02:12:02,432 --> 02:12:04,992
It'll provide more water for growing cities

2384
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:09,856
It'll provide more water for expanding Industries for the farmers crop

2385
02:12:10,112 --> 02:12:11,392
And for the ranchers cat

2386
02:12:11,648 --> 02:12:13,184
And let us build

2387
02:12:14,208 --> 02:12:14,976
And Power

2388
02:12:15,488 --> 02:12:17,792
Kind of network of projects for irrigation

2389
02:12:21,120 --> 02:12:23,424
For electricity and finally for recreation

2390
02:12:23,936 --> 02:12:25,728
So by taking this action today

2391
02:12:26,240 --> 02:12:28,288
That we are making the Waters of the West

2392
02:12:29,568 --> 02:12:32,896
A little sweeter and we'll make the grass

2393
02:12:39,552 --> 02:12:45,696
This is the most expensive Water Works in Bureau history

2394
02:12:46,464 --> 02:12:47,744
The lifeline without which

2395
02:12:48,768 --> 02:12:51,584
Farms and homes in central Arizona could not exist

2396
02:12:52,608 --> 02:12:54,144
Glen Canyon power

2397
02:12:54,400 --> 02:12:56,704
And a giant coal-fired power plant

2398
02:12:56,960 --> 02:13:00,288
Drive pumps which lift the Colorado 300 miles

2399
02:13:00,544 --> 02:13:01,824
Uphill into

2400
02:13:02,080 --> 02:13:03,872
Tucson and Scottsdale

2401
02:13:04,384 --> 02:13:09,248
Phoenix has grown so large

2402
02:13:09,504 --> 02:13:10,272
That

2403
02:13:10,528 --> 02:13:12,320
Rome and Manhattan together

2404
02:13:12,576 --> 02:13:14,624
Could all fit within its city limits

2405
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,048
This is our Cambria 2 model

2406
02:13:23,328 --> 02:13:27,424
Is the largest home that we do in this particular Community it's about 1600 ft

2407
02:13:27,680 --> 02:13:31,008
The next room I want to show you is our third bedroom or Den

2408
02:13:31,520 --> 02:13:33,824
Right now I want to let you know that Arizona

2409
02:13:34,080 --> 02:13:34,592
Is about

2410
02:13:34,848 --> 02:13:37,664
Second hottest real estate market in the country next to Atlanta

2411
02:13:38,176 --> 02:13:42,016
Well the only thing they can get out of balance is if we get too many people

2412
02:13:43,296 --> 02:13:48,416
As I say when I was born here they were about 10,000 people living in the whole valley

2413
02:13:48,672 --> 02:13:49,952
Now they're 2 million

2414
02:13:50,208 --> 02:13:51,488
2 million is

2415
02:13:53,024 --> 02:13:57,376
Large number of people for us to service with water

2416
02:13:57,632 --> 02:14:02,496
The things that Reclamation deal in building water projects

2417
02:14:02,752 --> 02:14:04,288
Allowed a lot of growth

2418
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:06,848
But the problem we face today is that

2419
02:14:07,360 --> 02:14:09,152
There's just not enough water to go around

2420
02:14:09,408 --> 02:14:12,224
We have underground watering systems with a small drain

2421
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:14,016
To every plan small drip

2422
02:14:14,784 --> 02:14:19,392
We also have sprayer systems for the grassy areas and of course this is called Desert Landscaping

2423
02:14:21,440 --> 02:14:23,744
And my grandmother would go over there and fetch water

2424
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:24,768
Very little

2425
02:14:25,536 --> 02:14:26,048
And

2426
02:14:26,304 --> 02:14:28,352
Expected last maybe for a couple of days

2427
02:14:28,608 --> 02:14:30,912
And then when I when I see my grandmother

2428
02:14:31,424 --> 02:14:35,776
I wash dishes after dinner she put a water into one

2429
02:14:36,544 --> 02:14:38,080
Put her hand like that and she put

2430
02:14:38,336 --> 02:14:39,872
That same water into another

2431
02:14:40,384 --> 02:14:41,664
And then then she finally

2432
02:14:42,176 --> 02:14:44,480
Throw it out and that's how she uses water

2433
02:14:44,736 --> 02:14:46,784
Because of water has to last a long time

2434
02:14:47,296 --> 02:14:50,368
The reason why I would live in this desolate area is because

2435
02:14:50,624 --> 02:14:51,136
Is

2436
02:14:51,392 --> 02:14:54,208
And that's the only way that you can be as

2437
02:14:54,720 --> 02:14:56,256
To the spiritual being

2438
02:14:56,768 --> 02:14:59,328
And the closer you are to the spiritual being

2439
02:15:00,352 --> 02:15:03,168
The more that you are will maintain your humbl

2440
02:15:03,680 --> 02:15:06,496
So we look at this survival in terms of

2441
02:15:06,752 --> 02:15:08,800
Maybe thousands of years in the future

2442
02:15:10,592 --> 02:15:12,896
As you can see right now we're lucky

2443
02:15:13,408 --> 02:15:14,432
The Fountains going off

2444
02:15:15,456 --> 02:15:16,736
Right through the trees over here

2445
02:15:17,248 --> 02:15:19,296
That goes off every hour on the hour

2446
02:15:19,808 --> 02:15:20,576
The fountain

2447
02:15:20,832 --> 02:15:24,160
Shoots up over 500 ft it's actually taller than the Washington Monument

2448
02:15:25,696 --> 02:15:26,976
There will never be enough

2449
02:15:27,232 --> 02:15:27,744
Water

2450
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:29,024
In the Colorado River

2451
02:15:29,536 --> 02:15:35,680
To satisfy all the man on ever we will never augmented by relocating Another River from the

2452
02:15:35,936 --> 02:15:38,752
Northwest to make it bigger and when the pie doesn't grow

2453
02:15:39,008 --> 02:15:40,544
You just cut smaller pieces of

2454
02:15:41,056 --> 02:15:42,336
Perhaps we've created

2455
02:15:44,128 --> 02:15:47,456
Some problems that we'll never solve and by attract

2456
02:15:47,712 --> 02:15:49,760
People making it easier for people

2457
02:15:50,784 --> 02:15:53,088
To move into a harsh environment

2458
02:15:53,600 --> 02:15:55,392
I don't know why everybody should have a

2459
02:15:55,648 --> 02:15:57,184
Cool Maryland backyard

2460
02:15:57,696 --> 02:16:00,256
I don't know why they should have a green lawn and when

2461
02:16:00,512 --> 02:16:02,048
Practice would look better in the desert envir

2462
02:16:02,560 --> 02:16:06,400
I can sit here in 1995 and I can say to John Wesley pound you were wrong

2463
02:16:06,912 --> 02:16:10,496
The Colorado River at that time was a whole different river system

2464
02:16:11,264 --> 02:16:12,544
And it was running wild

2465
02:16:13,056 --> 02:16:14,848
And it didn't look very manageable

2466
02:16:15,104 --> 02:16:17,152
But we've engineered our way out of that problem

2467
02:16:17,408 --> 02:16:17,920
We have

2468
02:16:18,176 --> 02:16:19,712
So many dams and Reservoir

2469
02:16:19,968 --> 02:16:22,528
Net system that there is adequate water

2470
02:16:22,784 --> 02:16:23,552
Colorado

2471
02:16:25,088 --> 02:16:27,648
But the system is fragile

2472
02:16:28,160 --> 02:16:34,304
Runoff predictions went to Ryan 1983 thundering water ripped Boulders in Pulver

2473
02:16:40,960 --> 02:16:47,104
Whenever a little fancy I don't want the damn to go all at

2474
02:16:47,360 --> 02:16:50,688
It would stick out Hoover Park and Davis Downstream because they're not

2475
02:16:51,712 --> 02:16:54,784
To handle 26 minutes computer water coming down all at once

2476
02:16:55,040 --> 02:17:00,416
If Hoover Dam collapse the entire economy of the Southwest would be

2477
02:17:01,184 --> 02:17:01,952
Catast

2478
02:17:02,976 --> 02:17:03,488
Affected

2479
02:17:03,744 --> 02:17:09,888
We we can't imagine until something like this happens how dependently become and the Liberties we've taken

2480
02:17:10,144 --> 02:17:15,264
With the natural order

2481
02:17:15,520 --> 02:17:16,800
In Phoenix

2482
02:17:17,312 --> 02:17:19,872
The average August temperature is over 100

2483
02:17:20,128 --> 02:17:26,016
Here and there amidst the abundance are a few abandoned orange groves in subdivisions

2484
02:17:26,272 --> 02:17:28,576
Their supply of Colorado water shut off

2485
02:17:30,624 --> 02:17:36,768
This is what happens when the water stops

2486
02:17:37,024 --> 02:17:37,792
Today

2487
02:17:38,048 --> 02:17:42,144
More people farms and industries depend on the Colorado

2488
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:44,704
But on any comparable river in the world

2489
02:17:45,984 --> 02:17:50,848
Never had such a river been asked to do so much

2490
02:18:13,888 --> 02:18:14,912
When you drive

2491
02:18:15,168 --> 02:18:19,008
Interstate 5 between San Francisco and Los Angeles UC

2492
02:18:19,264 --> 02:18:25,408
Feels smiles and miles of cuddersfield so you see row crops and sea Orchards anything out there's some

2493
02:18:25,664 --> 02:18:26,944
It's a real

2494
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:31,808
This just would have been possible within the pre-existing natural order the

2495
02:18:32,064 --> 02:18:33,856
Is coming from hundreds of miles away

2496
02:18:34,112 --> 02:18:35,392
To concrete River

2497
02:18:37,952 --> 02:18:42,304
Without these fasting Water Works that we know which are all but invisible

2498
02:18:42,816 --> 02:18:45,376
Somewhere off in the distance is a huge

2499
02:18:45,632 --> 02:18:46,912
Without carrying water

2500
02:18:48,704 --> 02:18:49,216
But if

2501
02:18:49,728 --> 02:18:51,264
Somehow the water

2502
02:18:51,520 --> 02:18:56,128
Everybody is conscious of water

2503
02:18:56,896 --> 02:19:01,760
If you had for the river with a buck and empty bucket you'll ever get shot

2504
02:19:02,016 --> 02:19:02,784
Water makes

2505
02:19:04,064 --> 02:19:04,576
Can

2506
02:19:05,088 --> 02:19:08,160
A low value piece of property into something you can grow let

2507
02:19:08,928 --> 02:19:15,072
Wanted they would just be a dry desert here really

2508
02:19:15,328 --> 02:19:21,472
Water brings the green out here it's it's man-made compared to

2509
02:19:21,728 --> 02:19:24,800
What are you doing it back east

2510
02:19:25,056 --> 02:19:31,200
This looks like garlic over here there's a young almond Orchard over here right now we've got a field

2511
02:19:31,456 --> 02:19:37,600
Share this ready for planning for something probably gotten their Tomatoes these are pistachio trees here

2512
02:19:37,856 --> 02:19:44,000
More lettuce over here and garlic over here see this Bronco right here this tough grass you see on the edge of the road

2513
02:19:44,256 --> 02:19:46,048
This is the way it would have

2514
02:19:46,304 --> 02:19:50,400
100 years ago before water

2515
02:19:50,912 --> 02:19:57,056
10,000 trucks a day whole food to Market on Interstate 5

2516
02:19:57,312 --> 02:20:03,456
Hundreds of miles through the heart of California for nearly a cent

2517
02:20:03,712 --> 02:20:09,856
Congressman Governor's presidents and Farmers have fought bitterly to make nature do their bidding

2518
02:20:10,112 --> 02:20:16,256
They have

2519
02:20:16,512 --> 02:20:22,656
The history of the world here it is

2520
02:20:22,912 --> 02:20:29,056
Drier than North Africa and to bring water to this dry land we built the world's largest

2521
02:20:29,312 --> 02:20:35,456
And most expensive water works

2522
02:20:35,712 --> 02:20:41,856
This is the most completely transformed landscape of its size anywhere on Earth

2523
02:20:48,512 --> 02:20:54,656
Food

2524
02:21:01,312 --> 02:21:07,456
How did we achieve this and why do generations of Americans fight over this land where

2525
02:21:23,584 --> 02:21:29,728
Sierra Nevada rivers to the east have flooded a few weeks each spring since the beginning of

2526
02:21:34,592 --> 02:21:36,128
And fed the great swamps

2527
02:21:36,384 --> 02:21:37,408
100 mile

2528
02:21:38,432 --> 02:21:39,200
Every summer

2529
02:21:39,456 --> 02:21:40,736
The marshes evaporated

2530
02:21:41,248 --> 02:21:43,552
The Valley shimmered in withering Heat

2531
02:21:44,064 --> 02:21:46,112
It was the American Serengeti

2532
02:21:57,632 --> 02:22:00,704
This whole area was known as the Huron sink

2533
02:22:01,216 --> 02:22:04,544
It was kind of a swampy type thing with water

2534
02:22:04,800 --> 02:22:05,312
Un

2535
02:22:06,080 --> 02:22:06,848
I'm not very deep

2536
02:22:07,104 --> 02:22:08,640
But moving in and out

2537
02:22:08,896 --> 02:22:10,432
That's where the Indian

2538
02:22:11,712 --> 02:22:12,480
And

2539
02:22:12,736 --> 02:22:14,528
Do some fishing

2540
02:22:14,784 --> 02:22:16,064
Hard to believe today

2541
02:22:16,320 --> 02:22:19,392
The onions they were there during the winter month

2542
02:22:19,648 --> 02:22:24,512
And then they had high tailored over where it was cooler in the summer over for the Sierras

2543
02:22:26,816 --> 02:22:28,864
The Valley's natural Web of Life

2544
02:22:29,120 --> 02:22:35,008
Had evolved over thousands of wet Winters and dry summers in a few game Reserves

2545
02:22:35,264 --> 02:22:38,336
Bits of the original Valley survive to this day

2546
02:22:38,848 --> 02:22:41,408
Unbelievable

2547
02:22:41,664 --> 02:22:47,040
80 to 100 million bucks and geese with winter

2548
02:22:51,392 --> 02:22:52,672
The sky was black

2549
02:22:52,928 --> 02:22:54,464
I've heard it from people still alive

2550
02:22:54,976 --> 02:22:55,744
This guy was black

2551
02:22:57,536 --> 02:22:58,816
There were Grizz

2552
02:22:59,328 --> 02:22:59,840
All over

2553
02:23:00,864 --> 02:23:03,424
And there were antelope

2554
02:23:03,680 --> 02:23:05,984
Millionaire tullioch

2555
02:23:07,008 --> 02:23:10,592
You can find here and there tiny tiny little

2556
02:23:11,616 --> 02:23:12,128
But

2557
02:23:12,896 --> 02:23:13,408
It was

2558
02:23:15,200 --> 02:23:17,760
It's completely and irre

2559
02:23:18,528 --> 02:23:19,040
And UT

2560
02:23:19,296 --> 02:23:20,576
Play transformed now

2561
02:23:21,088 --> 02:23:25,952
The Central Valley has one

2562
02:23:26,464 --> 02:23:26,976
Drawback

2563
02:23:27,488 --> 02:23:31,840
It stops raining in most years in April or May and it starts raining again

2564
02:23:32,096 --> 02:23:32,608
In November

2565
02:23:33,120 --> 02:23:34,400
And then when it

2566
02:23:35,680 --> 02:23:41,312
The town of Sonora got 78 in of rain

2567
02:23:41,568 --> 02:23:43,104
6 weeks

2568
02:23:43,360 --> 02:23:44,896
Central Valley was a lake

2569
02:23:45,408 --> 02:23:46,688
The size of Lake ontar

2570
02:23:47,200 --> 02:23:51,552
It was 250 miles long and 40 miles wide and

2571
02:23:51,808 --> 02:23:52,320
Underwater

2572
02:23:52,576 --> 02:23:53,600
The only way to get

2573
02:23:53,856 --> 02:23:55,904
San Francisco to Sacramento was by boat

2574
02:23:56,416 --> 02:23:57,952
Sacramento was completely

2575
02:23:58,208 --> 02:24:01,024
Play underwater in 1850 and again in 18

2576
02:24:01,280 --> 02:24:01,792
52

2577
02:24:02,048 --> 02:24:03,072
From the moment

2578
02:24:03,328 --> 02:24:05,376
That flood receded the politician

2579
02:24:05,888 --> 02:24:06,656
The state legislatur

2580
02:24:06,912 --> 02:24:08,448
Said we've simply got

2581
02:24:08,704 --> 02:24:09,472
To do something

2582
02:24:09,984 --> 02:24:10,752
The control nature here

2583
02:24:11,008 --> 02:24:12,544
Or we can't continue to live here

2584
02:24:13,056 --> 02:24:14,336
And that was really the beginning

2585
02:24:14,592 --> 02:24:16,640
One of the not transformation of the valley

2586
02:24:23,808 --> 02:24:28,928
A 19th century law allowed anyone to claim land over which he could sail in a boat

2587
02:24:29,184 --> 02:24:35,328
Henry Miller staked out his claims for

2588
02:24:35,584 --> 02:24:38,400
Section of land in a boat

2589
02:24:38,912 --> 02:24:40,704
He was just another one of those

2590
02:24:40,960 --> 02:24:44,288
California who came here from somewhere else reinvented him

2591
02:24:44,544 --> 02:24:45,568
Completely he did a

2592
02:24:46,336 --> 02:24:52,480
He would float around and Mark Drive posting around and marked his territory and the law

2593
02:24:52,736 --> 02:24:58,880
Required to be done from a boat so that's just what he did and then when the flood went away

2594
02:24:59,136 --> 02:25:05,280
According to history he put a boat in a Buckboard wagon and then had it pulled by a team of horses

2595
02:25:05,536 --> 02:25:06,304
A buggy or wag

2596
02:25:06,816 --> 02:25:08,096
And what traits in across

2597
02:25:09,376 --> 02:25:10,400
A considerable

2598
02:25:10,912 --> 02:25:11,680
Whose Empire

2599
02:25:11,936 --> 02:25:12,704
Ultimately

2600
02:25:13,216 --> 02:25:13,984
1 million

2601
02:25:14,752 --> 02:25:15,776
90,000 Acres

2602
02:25:16,032 --> 02:25:17,056
For his era

2603
02:25:17,824 --> 02:25:18,848
You'd have to take your hat

2604
02:25:19,616 --> 02:25:21,664
And he was the first person to build a

2605
02:25:22,176 --> 02:25:24,480
Yes significantly size damn in California

2606
02:25:24,992 --> 02:25:26,272
And that led to

2607
02:25:26,528 --> 02:25:27,552
1200 other

2608
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:30,112
Significant size that we built since then

2609
02:25:31,904 --> 02:25:33,952
In the late 19th century

2610
02:25:34,464 --> 02:25:36,256
Pioneers built small dams

2611
02:25:36,512 --> 02:25:39,072
Drained marshes and dog canal

2612
02:25:40,864 --> 02:25:47,008
They found themselves at the mercy of Nature and the heavens for rain

2613
02:25:47,264 --> 02:25:51,104
They hope that the range would be timely enough to to get a

2614
02:25:51,616 --> 02:25:52,896
Obviously it was

2615
02:25:53,152 --> 02:25:55,968
And if they got into a reasonably West

2616
02:25:56,224 --> 02:25:57,504
They could do reasonably well

2617
02:25:58,016 --> 02:25:58,784
It's a lot of praying

2618
02:25:59,040 --> 02:26:00,320
Said that with a lot of

2619
02:26:00,832 --> 02:26:02,368
Yeah they sent their wives

2620
02:26:02,624 --> 02:26:04,160
The church I know every Sunday

2621
02:26:12,096 --> 02:26:15,936
But a vast aquifer of pure water lay just Underground

2622
02:26:16,448 --> 02:26:16,960
Built up

2623
02:26:17,472 --> 02:26:18,752
Like water in a sponge

2624
02:26:19,264 --> 02:26:20,544
Over thousands of winters

2625
02:26:21,312 --> 02:26:23,872
In a few places it even gushed up to the surface

2626
02:26:25,408 --> 02:26:26,688
After World War I

2627
02:26:27,200 --> 02:26:31,552
Traveling salesman went from Farm to farm selling powerful new turbine pumps

2628
02:26:32,320 --> 02:26:36,416
Now farmers could pump as much groundwater as they needed

2629
02:26:37,440 --> 02:26:38,720
In 1929

2630
02:26:38,976 --> 02:26:43,072
California pulled ahead of Iowa as America's leading Farm state

2631
02:26:43,584 --> 02:26:44,608
Even as Dr

2632
02:26:44,864 --> 02:26:46,400
Settled over the valley

2633
02:26:56,384 --> 02:27:01,504
Before long rose had pumped the San Joaquin water table down

2634
02:27:01,760 --> 02:27:02,272
10

2635
02:27:04,320 --> 02:27:05,600
And by 1930

2636
02:27:05,856 --> 02:27:09,184
They had $24,000 turbine pumps on the aquifer

2637
02:27:09,696 --> 02:27:12,256
Drawing it down to 100 ft below the surface

2638
02:27:13,280 --> 02:27:19,424
Deep rooted Oaks on the San Joaquin Plains began to die

2639
02:27:21,984 --> 02:27:24,032
70,000 refugees from the

2640
02:27:24,288 --> 02:27:26,080
Football present a new problem to California

2641
02:27:26,848 --> 02:27:27,360
Water

2642
02:27:27,616 --> 02:27:30,432
Bring up and living conditions alarm the health author

2643
02:27:31,200 --> 02:27:34,016
These newcomers seek to make a living by following the har

2644
02:27:34,528 --> 02:27:37,600
Working in the fields called for more labor

2645
02:27:37,856 --> 02:27:41,440
The Promised Land

2646
02:27:41,696 --> 02:27:42,720
To California

2647
02:27:43,232 --> 02:27:44,512
They're almost all

2648
02:27:45,792 --> 02:27:49,632
People driven from their own homes by dust storms without ill

2649
02:27:49,888 --> 02:27:50,656
Hard

2650
02:27:58,592 --> 02:28:01,152
Some of the most famous

2651
02:28:01,408 --> 02:28:01,920
Photograph

2652
02:28:02,432 --> 02:28:08,576
Ever taken hard Dorothy Alliance photographs of the Okies if you will the migrants in the Great

2653
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:12,928
What people may not know is that most of those photograph

2654
02:28:13,184 --> 02:28:14,720
Thanks for taking into San Joaquin Valley

2655
02:28:14,976 --> 02:28:15,488
California

2656
02:28:17,792 --> 02:28:18,304
Where it

2657
02:28:18,816 --> 02:28:19,840
That's where the

2658
02:28:20,352 --> 02:28:21,120
Population

2659
02:28:21,376 --> 02:28:22,144
Migration

2660
02:28:23,936 --> 02:28:30,080
Waves of

2661
02:28:30,336 --> 02:28:33,920
Refugees found Farmers leveling new tracks of land

2662
02:28:36,992 --> 02:28:42,112
Cheap labor and cheap water were key to the expansion

2663
02:28:46,720 --> 02:28:49,024
But migrants could not see

2664
02:28:49,280 --> 02:28:51,840
Was that girl is we're pumping the aquifer dry

2665
02:28:53,632 --> 02:28:56,448
I think about hundreds of gallons a minute

2666
02:28:56,704 --> 02:29:01,056
Sounds like a firehouse there was something like 24,000 pumps big pump

2667
02:29:03,616 --> 02:29:04,128
Here

2668
02:29:04,640 --> 02:29:05,920
They overdraft

2669
02:29:06,688 --> 02:29:07,456
They mind it

2670
02:29:07,968 --> 02:29:08,736
So fast

2671
02:29:08,992 --> 02:29:10,016
That the valley subsided

2672
02:29:10,528 --> 02:29:12,832
Portions of the San Joaquin Valley dropped three

2673
02:29:14,112 --> 02:29:17,184
You're pulling out a hundred buckets of water

2674
02:29:17,952 --> 02:29:20,000
And only a couple is being replenish

2675
02:29:22,816 --> 02:29:25,376
If this is a this is a losing deal

2676
02:29:25,632 --> 02:29:26,656
There's no question about it

2677
02:29:29,216 --> 02:29:30,752
By the middle of the Great Depression

2678
02:29:31,008 --> 02:29:35,616
The promised land California's Great Central Valley was running out of water

2679
02:29:36,640 --> 02:29:39,712
Now

2680
02:29:39,968 --> 02:29:46,112
Farmers could even limit their pumping and produce less or they could search for new water

2681
02:29:54,048 --> 02:30:00,192
At the Sierras in if there is a cloud layer or a cloud formation you can see through the heights you can see the snow

2682
02:30:00,448 --> 02:30:02,496
Just capping the whole top of the

2683
02:30:03,008 --> 02:30:05,824
The whole top of the mountains that surround the valley floor

2684
02:30:10,432 --> 02:30:16,576
Northern California's West blizzard raging for a week without a letter buries the CL in the Bible region in 13 ft

2685
02:30:17,856 --> 02:30:22,464
Every Spring Ciara snow melt roared down the salmon rivers and out to sea

2686
02:30:22,976 --> 02:30:25,792
Cut off from the outside world by snow choke highways

2687
02:30:26,048 --> 02:30:27,072
Evans

2688
02:30:27,328 --> 02:30:33,472
Just to the east of the farm counties once got 73 ft of snow deepest ever recorded

2689
02:30:33,728 --> 02:30:37,568
Anywhere in the world

2690
02:30:37,824 --> 02:30:43,968
Scores of cars only the federal government which had just conquered the Colorado River could move the snow

2691
02:30:44,224 --> 02:30:46,016
The Farms across California

2692
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:48,064
The New Deal

2693
02:30:48,576 --> 02:30:49,600
Came along

2694
02:30:50,112 --> 02:30:52,672
An exquisitely opportune time

2695
02:30:52,928 --> 02:30:53,440
It was

2696
02:30:56,768 --> 02:30:59,584
Growers turn to Franklin Roosevelt

2697
02:31:05,728 --> 02:31:09,312
America's newest engineering wonder is about to be dedicated

2698
02:31:09,568 --> 02:31:11,616
By the president of the United States

2699
02:31:11,872 --> 02:31:13,152
I have the right

2700
02:31:14,944 --> 02:31:15,968
Congratul

2701
02:31:18,016 --> 02:31:20,576
We'll have builded the bulldog

2702
02:31:24,928 --> 02:31:26,464
Even greater than Boulder Dam

2703
02:31:26,720 --> 02:31:28,256
The Central Valley Project

2704
02:31:29,536 --> 02:31:31,840
Here we have the most elabor

2705
02:31:32,352 --> 02:31:32,864
Irrigation

2706
02:31:33,120 --> 02:31:33,888
Project public work

2707
02:31:34,144 --> 02:31:35,168
Project ever built

2708
02:31:37,216 --> 02:31:38,752
What is desperately needed

2709
02:31:44,896 --> 02:31:48,480
Many politicians believe that the time that the government ought to be doing

2710
02:31:48,736 --> 02:31:54,880
This kind of stuff but he did

2711
02:32:14,336 --> 02:32:20,480
Reservoirs

2712
02:32:20,736 --> 02:32:26,880
Order an area the size of Lake Michigan no one had ever built anything like

2713
02:32:33,536 --> 02:32:34,816
Complex than Hoover Dam

2714
02:32:35,072 --> 02:32:38,912
It will be the biggest Public Works project since the Great Wall of China

2715
02:32:39,168 --> 02:32:45,312
It would be the most expensive Water Works in history

2716
02:32:45,568 --> 02:32:51,712
Monument

2717
02:32:51,968 --> 02:32:55,552
On behalf of the Bureau of Reclamation I like to welcome all of you to

2718
02:32:55,808 --> 02:32:58,368
That's the damn my name is Sherry and I'm a beer tour guide today

2719
02:32:58,880 --> 02:33:05,024
Shasta dam is the second largest concrete gravity type dam in the United States now this was

2720
02:33:05,280 --> 02:33:11,424
Instructor during the end of the depression that's gave him was 5,000 people in their families employment this was a big deal

2721
02:33:11,680 --> 02:33:17,824
And people did come from everywhere to get a job

2722
02:33:18,080 --> 02:33:24,224
Right now in 1935 most Americans had never heard of the

2723
02:33:24,480 --> 02:33:30,624
Fiorella of reclamation

2724
02:33:32,416 --> 02:33:38,560
This obscure agency would remake the face of the continent

2725
02:33:51,616 --> 02:33:57,760
These giant irrig

2726
02:33:58,016 --> 02:34:01,856
Act of 1902

2727
02:34:03,392 --> 02:34:06,208
Congress had passed the ACT a quarter Century before

2728
02:34:06,464 --> 02:34:09,024
To stop the sort of land grabs Henry Miller had

2729
02:34:09,280 --> 02:34:09,792
Frustrated

2730
02:34:14,656 --> 02:34:18,240
Go to the headquarters of the Bureau of Reclamation in Washington

2731
02:34:18,496 --> 02:34:21,056
You see murals all over the place and they

2732
02:34:21,312 --> 02:34:22,080
I picked

2733
02:34:22,592 --> 02:34:23,616
Grand development

2734
02:34:25,152 --> 02:34:25,664
And

2735
02:34:25,920 --> 02:34:27,200
Cultivation of land

2736
02:34:27,456 --> 02:34:29,504
And the arrival of settlers

2737
02:34:29,760 --> 02:34:33,600
New land new land all through irrigation otherwise it wouldn't exist

2738
02:34:33,856 --> 02:34:35,392
Those murals are everywhere

2739
02:34:36,416 --> 02:34:37,184
And of course

2740
02:34:37,952 --> 02:34:41,024
You're not in the west very long before you realize that the key is water

2741
02:34:41,280 --> 02:34:44,864
I think clearly that the original intent was if we got the water

2742
02:34:45,632 --> 02:34:46,400
To the land

2743
02:34:46,656 --> 02:34:48,192
We can put Farmers on it

2744
02:34:48,960 --> 02:34:50,240
This was a settling of the West

2745
02:34:50,496 --> 02:34:53,568
That was the best of intense and in fact it was written into the

2746
02:34:53,824 --> 02:34:54,592
This was going to be

2747
02:34:54,848 --> 02:34:56,896
12 hours this was going to be for people

2748
02:34:57,152 --> 02:34:58,688
Who formed $160

2749
02:35:00,736 --> 02:35:04,576
Days after Congress passed the Reclamation Act in 1902

2750
02:35:04,832 --> 02:35:09,184
Speculators real estate brokers and Congressman began their horse Trading

2751
02:35:09,952 --> 02:35:14,560
Everyone could see that land with water was worth more than land without water

2752
02:35:14,816 --> 02:35:17,120
And every Senator wanted a water project

2753
02:35:21,728 --> 02:35:23,776
By law

2754
02:35:24,032 --> 02:35:26,080
Water would be sold at a fraction of its cost

2755
02:35:26,336 --> 02:35:28,896
It's too small 160 Acre Farms

2756
02:35:29,664 --> 02:35:33,504
It was true that many small farms would soon get government water

2757
02:35:34,272 --> 02:35:35,296
But eventually

2758
02:35:35,808 --> 02:35:38,880
The largest recipient of the largest water project in history

2759
02:35:39,136 --> 02:35:40,928
Would not be a small farmer

2760
02:35:41,440 --> 02:35:43,232
But the Southern Pacific Railroad

2761
02:35:43,488 --> 02:35:46,560
Largest landowner in California

2762
02:35:48,352 --> 02:35:51,936
By World War II CVP canals would work their Way South

2763
02:35:52,192 --> 02:35:55,520
And soon transform the valley into the Bread Basket of the world

2764
02:36:01,152 --> 02:36:02,176
Far to the South

2765
02:36:02,432 --> 02:36:06,272
Farmers around Tulare Lake begin lobbying for their own water project

2766
02:36:08,320 --> 02:36:09,600
But high water

2767
02:36:09,856 --> 02:36:10,624
Could be

2768
02:36:10,880 --> 02:36:17,024
45 Mi about 22 Mi down that way in about 22 miles up this way and then it'd be about 10 miles

2769
02:36:18,048 --> 02:36:20,864
And 10 miles this way 10 miles west 10 miles east

2770
02:36:21,120 --> 02:36:21,632
And then

2771
02:36:21,888 --> 02:36:24,192
You'd be about 22

2772
02:36:24,704 --> 02:36:25,472
Feet deep

2773
02:36:25,728 --> 02:36:26,752
If it was the Deep

2774
02:36:27,008 --> 02:36:28,800
This part of the lake that was by the water which

2775
02:36:29,312 --> 02:36:30,848
Sound is on there

2776
02:36:31,104 --> 02:36:32,896
And then your face should be Swimming by

2777
02:36:34,176 --> 02:36:36,480
Tulare Lake was 2 million years old

2778
02:36:36,736 --> 02:36:38,272
One of the oldest Lakes on Earth

2779
02:36:38,784 --> 02:36:43,136
45 miles long it was the largest freshwater lake west of the Mississippi

2780
02:36:45,184 --> 02:36:46,208
When it flourish

2781
02:36:46,464 --> 02:36:48,000
In May and June with the

2782
02:36:50,048 --> 02:36:51,072
The whole celebrity

2783
02:36:51,328 --> 02:36:54,144
So it could be twice three times the size of Lake Tahoe and what years

2784
02:36:54,656 --> 02:36:58,240
It was probably the last place in the Central Valley that really was

2785
02:37:00,544 --> 02:37:02,592
If you get a lot of rain we had a lot of Lake

2786
02:37:02,848 --> 02:37:06,432
We didn't get much rain we had very little late and that's why a lot of people said it's kind of

2787
02:37:06,688 --> 02:37:07,712
Magical

2788
02:37:07,968 --> 02:37:11,296
You know a lot of rabbits and coyotes and things like that

2789
02:37:11,808 --> 02:37:15,648
So it was a it was just a real nice spot you know for hunting and fishing

2790
02:37:19,488 --> 02:37:24,096
4 years North American Fleet has been produced most profitably on large farm

2791
02:37:25,120 --> 02:37:29,984
But today none is more thoroughly industrialized in the 50,000 acre to Laura Lake Ranch

2792
02:37:33,312 --> 02:37:36,896
Not far from the lake on land once claimed by Henry Miller

2793
02:37:37,152 --> 02:37:40,480
Some of the wealthiest farmers in the world raised wheat and cotton

2794
02:37:41,504 --> 02:37:43,040
We have about 35

2795
02:37:43,296 --> 02:37:44,064
Bob's

2796
02:37:44,320 --> 02:37:45,600
Pictures of grain and

2797
02:37:45,856 --> 02:37:47,392
7,500 AC

2798
02:37:47,648 --> 02:37:48,160
Cot

2799
02:37:48,928 --> 02:37:50,976
We have 250 MI

2800
02:37:51,232 --> 02:37:52,768
Canals and ditches

2801
02:37:53,536 --> 02:37:54,560
On our Ranch

2802
02:37:55,328 --> 02:37:57,120
All of our land is

2803
02:37:58,400 --> 02:37:59,680
Under irrigation

2804
02:38:03,008 --> 02:38:05,568
And dryers

2805
02:38:05,824 --> 02:38:08,128
Growers could Farm bits of the lake bottom

2806
02:38:08,384 --> 02:38:14,528
But they wanted to farm it all in 1940 the bureau agreed to build irrig

2807
02:38:14,784 --> 02:38:20,928
Vacation dance on Rivers feeding the ancient Lake the law would then Force Growers to sell off their huge

2808
02:38:21,184 --> 02:38:24,768
The idea of

2809
02:38:25,280 --> 02:38:26,048
Subduing nature

2810
02:38:26,560 --> 02:38:27,072
Captiv

2811
02:38:27,328 --> 02:38:28,864
At the hall country

2812
02:38:29,120 --> 02:38:29,632
Practically

2813
02:38:32,448 --> 02:38:38,080
Are the Army Corps of Engineers Civil Works branch of the Army and the purification

2814
02:38:39,360 --> 02:38:41,152
Cannot appropriate enough money

2815
02:38:41,408 --> 02:38:43,968
That's enough for these agencies to build more dams

2816
02:38:44,224 --> 02:38:47,552
I'll give you your dad you give me mine that's the way it works

2817
02:38:48,064 --> 02:38:49,088
Here's to Federal

2818
02:38:49,344 --> 02:38:50,624
She's going to two different committees

2819
02:38:51,136 --> 02:38:51,904
For author

2820
02:38:53,440 --> 02:38:54,976
Two different sets of rules

2821
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:56,512
All

2822
02:38:56,768 --> 02:38:57,792
From the same pocket

2823
02:38:58,048 --> 02:38:58,816
Federal Tre

2824
02:38:59,328 --> 02:39:01,888
And the core and the bureau ended up in

2825
02:39:02,144 --> 02:39:03,168
Better better r

2826
02:39:03,680 --> 02:39:04,448
Over who could get

2827
02:39:04,704 --> 02:39:05,984
To the next damn side first

2828
02:39:06,752 --> 02:39:08,800
The Corps of Engineers had far different

2829
02:39:09,568 --> 02:39:10,848
Legislative auth

2830
02:39:12,128 --> 02:39:14,944
They could build a project without acreage limitation

2831
02:39:15,456 --> 02:39:16,736
They could build your project

2832
02:39:16,992 --> 02:39:19,808
With no operation maintenance responsibility for the

2833
02:39:20,064 --> 02:39:21,856
For the beneficiaries of the project

2834
02:39:22,112 --> 02:39:23,392
And no repayment

2835
02:39:23,648 --> 02:39:24,160
Responsib

2836
02:39:24,672 --> 02:39:25,184
From the benef

2837
02:39:26,976 --> 02:39:28,512
So this was pretty tough compet

2838
02:39:29,536 --> 02:39:31,072
The core damn the rivers

2839
02:39:31,328 --> 02:39:32,352
Dried out the leg

2840
02:39:32,608 --> 02:39:36,960
And then brought back what had been to Larry's water to irrigate the dry lake bed

2841
02:39:41,056 --> 02:39:42,080
Many hundred

2842
02:39:42,336 --> 02:39:43,104
20

2843
02:39:44,640 --> 02:39:46,176
Became these diet

2844
02:39:46,432 --> 02:39:47,200
Business

2845
02:39:48,224 --> 02:39:50,528
These corporations have so much we

2846
02:39:52,064 --> 02:39:55,392
Practically free they basically have run AG

2847
02:39:58,720 --> 02:40:01,536
Thousands of Acres of cotton in

2848
02:40:01,792 --> 02:40:04,096
Thousands really I'd say probably

2849
02:40:04,608 --> 02:40:05,376
Million Acres

2850
02:40:05,632 --> 02:40:07,936
I didn't know in this area all around us from

2851
02:40:08,192 --> 02:40:11,264
Right back to Texas as far as you can see is cotton

2852
02:40:11,520 --> 02:40:13,568
So you know it's big acreage

2853
02:40:14,080 --> 02:40:17,920
Overwhelms people who come into the area and look around but

2854
02:40:18,176 --> 02:40:21,760
But the water is the essential thing without that water

2855
02:40:22,272 --> 02:40:23,296
Can't grow the cotton

2856
02:40:23,808 --> 02:40:26,624
I

2857
02:40:27,136 --> 02:40:30,464
Donatellite Basin just a couple years ago and

2858
02:40:31,232 --> 02:40:31,744
I

2859
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,048
Find a lake I know I was

2860
02:40:34,816 --> 02:40:35,584
Approaching it

2861
02:40:36,096 --> 02:40:38,144
I was suddenly on it

2862
02:40:38,656 --> 02:40:40,704
And then I was miles into it

2863
02:40:40,960 --> 02:40:41,984
In my car

2864
02:40:46,592 --> 02:40:47,872
Completely obliterated

2865
02:40:56,832 --> 02:41:02,464
Blade is now 50 miles of cloud cotton field along Interstate 5

2866
02:41:09,632 --> 02:41:15,776
This is just like Las Vegas

2867
02:41:16,032 --> 02:41:22,176
Never stops in my father's front room talking about

2868
02:41:22,432 --> 02:41:26,528
Plowing the land 24 hours a day keeping it

2869
02:41:26,784 --> 02:41:32,928
Preparing the soil for planting and how they would swing in quarter-mile

2870
02:41:34,976 --> 02:41:39,584
You know it was about Lady of these of linking huge tract

2871
02:41:39,840 --> 02:41:44,192
Plot the land to level the land turn the land to to irrigate

2872
02:41:44,448 --> 02:41:50,592
We had built the CVP to relieve strain on over pumped groundwater

2873
02:41:50,848 --> 02:41:55,968
But with so many acres of new crops Farmers increase their pumping

2874
02:41:56,224 --> 02:41:57,248
The aquifer

2875
02:41:59,040 --> 02:42:03,648
And now the exploding population of Los Angeles want Valley Water

2876
02:42:11,072 --> 02:42:12,864
Even with the Central Valley Project

2877
02:42:13,376 --> 02:42:15,168
California's once again wanted

2878
02:42:15,424 --> 02:42:15,936
More

2879
02:42:21,056 --> 02:42:21,824
Does Papa Brown

2880
02:42:22,336 --> 02:42:24,640
This past promise California

2881
02:42:25,152 --> 02:42:25,920
But they would have

2882
02:42:26,176 --> 02:42:26,944
Of water

2883
02:42:27,200 --> 02:42:32,320
Growers ask Governor Brown to build a state financed flood control and irrigation project

2884
02:42:33,344 --> 02:42:34,368
Oh my father seem to be

2885
02:42:34,624 --> 02:42:35,136
Obsessed

2886
02:42:35,392 --> 02:42:36,160
With water

2887
02:42:37,184 --> 02:42:37,952
He talked about it

2888
02:42:38,464 --> 02:42:42,304
All the time in fact I remember when he would give speeches

2889
02:42:42,560 --> 02:42:43,584
Running for governor

2890
02:42:43,840 --> 02:42:45,120
The last time

2891
02:42:45,376 --> 02:42:51,008
He would give these speeches and talk about water all the time and he'd come back and he said I know it's not sex

2892
02:42:51,776 --> 02:42:53,056
I know people aren't listening

2893
02:42:53,312 --> 02:42:54,592
But water is important

2894
02:42:56,128 --> 02:42:56,640
Made it happen

2895
02:42:56,896 --> 02:42:59,456
A man-made River 600 miles long

2896
02:43:02,272 --> 02:43:03,296
It's always a disaster

2897
02:43:03,552 --> 02:43:04,320
Whether it's a Dr

2898
02:43:04,576 --> 02:43:05,088
For a flood

2899
02:43:05,344 --> 02:43:08,416
That gets the state rolling again and in 19

2900
02:43:09,440 --> 02:43:10,208
One of the worst

2901
02:43:10,464 --> 02:43:10,976
What

2902
02:43:14,048 --> 02:43:16,608
Went over his bags in the Yuba City and

2903
02:43:17,120 --> 02:43:18,912
Down in the Sacramento Valley is almost

2904
02:43:19,168 --> 02:43:19,680
Destroyed

2905
02:43:21,984 --> 02:43:23,264
Pat Brown n

2906
02:43:23,520 --> 02:43:26,080
That almost all Californians believed

2907
02:43:26,336 --> 02:43:27,616
Flood control and IR

2908
02:43:29,920 --> 02:43:30,944
He wanted to build

2909
02:43:31,456 --> 02:43:31,968
Statewide

2910
02:43:32,480 --> 02:43:34,272
It was an unheard of idea

2911
02:43:34,528 --> 02:43:37,088
For any state even the rich State like California

2912
02:43:37,600 --> 02:43:38,624
To build something

2913
02:43:39,136 --> 02:43:39,648
That big

2914
02:43:49,120 --> 02:43:52,704
Brown State Water Project squeaked by on a 3% margin

2915
02:43:56,544 --> 02:43:59,872
Even though we already had the largest Water Works in the world

2916
02:44:00,384 --> 02:44:01,920
The theory was it if any water

2917
02:44:02,176 --> 02:44:03,200
The ocean it was wasted

2918
02:44:03,968 --> 02:44:04,992
And so you got to grab

2919
02:44:05,504 --> 02:44:06,528
And put it somewhere else

2920
02:44:06,784 --> 02:44:08,832
Large scale excavation project

2921
02:44:09,344 --> 02:44:11,136
Such as harbors and canals

2922
02:44:11,392 --> 02:44:14,976
The University of California and the atomic energy Commission

2923
02:44:15,232 --> 02:44:18,560
Tested nuclear explosions for Excavating waterways

2924
02:44:19,840 --> 02:44:25,984
Sedan was detonated at 10:00 a.m. July 6th 1962

2925
02:44:32,640 --> 02:44:38,784
3 seconds

2926
02:44:39,040 --> 02:44:39,552
Disaster

2927
02:44:39,808 --> 02:44:43,904
Officials abandoned any thought of nuclear Canal building in the Central Valley

2928
02:44:48,256 --> 02:44:49,536
On its own

2929
02:44:49,792 --> 02:44:55,936
The state of California was building its own water works just as big just as expensive as the Central Valley

2930
02:44:56,192 --> 02:44:56,704
Play project

2931
02:44:57,216 --> 02:45:01,056
Background Waterworks would cost as much as the Manhattan Project

2932
02:45:01,568 --> 02:45:07,712
The size of the state Water Project is something you almost have to see but believe horrible

2933
02:45:07,968 --> 02:45:08,992
Solita

2934
02:45:09,248 --> 02:45:10,784
And almost half a mile

2935
02:45:11,808 --> 02:45:14,368
Talk about 150 ft high of the Eiffel Tower

2936
02:45:14,624 --> 02:45:16,160
The pump

2937
02:45:16,416 --> 02:45:22,560
If it had to be mountains is about 3,000 ft so you have a river running uphill

2938
02:45:22,816 --> 02:45:28,960
Returns of a mile even before the Central Valley Project was finished we

2939
02:45:29,216 --> 02:45:30,496
We were already building a

2940
02:45:30,752 --> 02:45:32,032
Project just as big

2941
02:45:32,288 --> 02:45:38,432
The presidential helicopter stairs up clouds of dust as

2942
02:45:38,688 --> 02:45:44,832
Federal state conservation endeavor

2943
02:45:47,136 --> 02:45:48,672
I'll blow up this Valley

2944
02:45:57,888 --> 02:45:59,168
By the late '60s

2945
02:45:59,424 --> 02:46:03,264
Federal and state water works had lifted the rivers out of their ancient beds

2946
02:46:03,519 --> 02:46:06,591
And deliver them to every corner of the great dry Valley

2947
02:46:07,359 --> 02:46:08,127
Soon

2948
02:46:08,383 --> 02:46:13,503
Bureau of water would reach even the Westlands most desolate part of the San Joaquin

2949
02:46:14,015 --> 02:46:17,087
1000 square mile District as dry as the Mojave

2950
02:46:20,159 --> 02:46:25,535
The local Congressman predicted that the Westlands would soon be settled by thousands of small farmers

2951
02:46:33,983 --> 02:46:34,751
Need more

2952
02:46:35,007 --> 02:46:35,519
It's okay

2953
02:46:35,775 --> 02:46:40,639
A large bumps are going to a 283 decrease the total release of feather river

2954
02:46:41,151 --> 02:46:43,199
From 4,000 to 3,500

2955
02:46:43,711 --> 02:46:46,015
You really have to go to the control room

2956
02:46:47,039 --> 02:46:48,319
State and federal water

2957
02:46:48,831 --> 02:46:49,855
In Sacramento

2958
02:46:50,367 --> 02:46:52,415
I mean here we had these Rivers

2959
02:46:52,671 --> 02:46:53,183
Big

2960
02:46:56,767 --> 02:46:57,279
You have

2961
02:46:57,791 --> 02:46:58,303
A few techn

2962
02:46:58,815 --> 02:47:00,095
Sitting at a big

2963
02:47:00,351 --> 02:47:00,863
Computers

2964
02:47:01,119 --> 02:47:01,887
And I Reg

2965
02:47:02,399 --> 02:47:03,167
The whole thing

2966
02:47:03,423 --> 02:47:05,727
I thought every morning they decide

2967
02:47:05,983 --> 02:47:12,127
He's going to get how much water and power and they just meter it out and steady flow to 32 million people and 10 million AC

2968
02:47:13,919 --> 02:47:15,455
Feet

2969
02:47:15,967 --> 02:47:17,503
My 1974

2970
02:47:17,759 --> 02:47:21,087
The state of California had the sixth largest economy in the world

2971
02:47:21,599 --> 02:47:24,415
Larger than all but the five greatest industrial n

2972
02:47:27,999 --> 02:47:29,023
Without Rain

2973
02:47:29,279 --> 02:47:33,631
Farmers could grow nearly all the fruits and vegetables of the Midwest and Florida

2974
02:47:38,495 --> 02:47:39,519
Going to Canal

2975
02:47:40,543 --> 02:47:42,591
The farm really real big here

2976
02:47:43,103 --> 02:47:43,615
So

2977
02:47:43,871 --> 02:47:44,639
But I really miss

2978
02:47:46,431 --> 02:47:47,455
Make sure the

2979
02:47:49,503 --> 02:47:50,015
Coy

2980
02:47:50,271 --> 02:47:51,295
Everything I left

2981
02:47:51,807 --> 02:47:53,087
Then the machine came

2982
02:47:53,855 --> 02:47:56,415
And we all got scared as if we're going to be out of a job

2983
02:47:56,671 --> 02:47:57,183
But no

2984
02:47:59,231 --> 02:48:01,023
Who would drive the machine it was easier

2985
02:48:01,279 --> 02:48:07,423
If it rained in the summer we'd be in

2986
02:48:07,679 --> 02:48:09,727
Trouble it's the fact that through irrigation we can

2987
02:48:09,983 --> 02:48:10,495
Feistley

2988
02:48:10,751 --> 02:48:12,031
By the water at the right time

2989
02:48:12,287 --> 02:48:13,055
You can stress

2990
02:48:13,311 --> 02:48:15,359
The cotton plant you cannot give it water for a while

2991
02:48:15,615 --> 02:48:19,455
Not plant thinks it's going into a drought and it's going to put on the balls then you put the water to it

2992
02:48:19,711 --> 02:48:20,735
Can you get a better crop

2993
02:48:20,991 --> 02:48:23,039
Rain is an enemy

2994
02:48:23,295 --> 02:48:24,319
So we're

2995
02:48:24,575 --> 02:48:28,671
Ask with that dry summer and combine irrigation and you got you got something

2996
02:48:28,927 --> 02:48:29,439
Magical

2997
02:48:29,951 --> 02:48:36,095
The new water supplies brought new mechanization and spectacular production that continues

2998
02:48:39,423 --> 02:48:43,519
The University of California joined with Growers and manufacturers

2999
02:48:48,895 --> 02:48:53,503
For you you're talking about Farms that $20,000 Acres

3000
02:48:53,759 --> 02:48:59,903
50,000 Acres 100,000 acres and these lands just overwhelm anything

3001
02:49:00,159 --> 02:49:00,927
The people thought about

3002
02:49:03,743 --> 02:49:05,023
Eastern United States

3003
02:49:05,279 --> 02:49:06,815
There was just nothing like

3004
02:49:07,071 --> 02:49:10,143
Talk about it everybody else in the country was relying on God

3005
02:49:10,655 --> 02:49:12,447
And these guys got

3006
02:49:12,703 --> 02:49:13,727
Get out from the US government

3007
02:49:13,983 --> 02:49:14,495
They got it

3008
02:49:14,751 --> 02:49:15,519
When they wanted

3009
02:49:15,775 --> 02:49:16,543
Time of day

3010
02:49:17,055 --> 02:49:17,823
Day of the month

3011
02:49:18,591 --> 02:49:19,615
Time of the year

3012
02:49:19,871 --> 02:49:20,639
And

3013
02:49:20,895 --> 02:49:21,663
And they got

3014
02:49:21,919 --> 02:49:22,431
I almost

3015
02:49:22,687 --> 02:49:27,295
Free a few researchers noted alarming changes amid the prosperity

3016
02:49:27,807 --> 02:49:30,367
Accumulation of salt and pesticide residue

3017
02:49:30,879 --> 02:49:32,927
Worsening conditions for Farm labor

3018
02:49:33,695 --> 02:49:35,231
The lack of small farms

3019
02:49:35,487 --> 02:49:37,023
And The Disappearance of salmon

3020
02:49:37,279 --> 02:49:43,167
Congress did not share their concerns and Western water projects

3021
02:49:43,423 --> 02:49:46,239
Roll through Congress as they had for decades

3022
02:49:46,751 --> 02:49:51,103
I've always referred to it as the iron triangle which is really an all

3023
02:49:51,359 --> 02:49:52,895
It was developed between local sponsors

3024
02:49:53,151 --> 02:49:54,175
Their Congressional

3025
02:49:54,687 --> 02:49:55,455
On delegation

3026
02:49:55,967 --> 02:49:59,807
And the Bureau of Reclamation or the water development agency the Corps of Engineers

3027
02:50:00,575 --> 02:50:01,599
They were the heart

3028
02:50:01,855 --> 02:50:02,367
And the soul

3029
02:50:03,135 --> 02:50:07,231
They were the the oil that made the engine of the Congress run

3030
02:50:07,487 --> 02:50:09,023
People voted for each other's day

3031
02:50:10,559 --> 02:50:11,839
Every Congressman wanted one

3032
02:50:12,095 --> 02:50:14,655
And every Congressman got one if he voted for everybody else

3033
02:50:15,679 --> 02:50:16,703
The way that

3034
02:50:16,959 --> 02:50:17,727
Translation

3035
02:50:18,239 --> 02:50:19,263
Often was

3036
02:50:19,519 --> 02:50:23,103
The committee Chairman's favorite damn was stuck onto it even though it was an education

3037
02:50:23,871 --> 02:50:24,383
Damn

3038
02:50:24,895 --> 02:50:25,663
Mean

3039
02:50:26,175 --> 02:50:27,199
I mean the Civil Rights

3040
02:50:27,711 --> 02:50:29,247
For example would have never been

3041
02:50:29,503 --> 02:50:31,039
Without the benefit of

3042
02:50:31,295 --> 02:50:32,831
Of using you know

3043
02:50:33,599 --> 02:50:35,391
Pork barrel of water project

3044
02:50:37,183 --> 02:50:38,463
Staff in the White House

3045
02:50:38,719 --> 02:50:39,231
And

3046
02:50:39,743 --> 02:50:40,255
Bud

3047
02:50:40,511 --> 02:50:43,327
Prepared as a matter of routine a list of water

3048
02:50:43,839 --> 02:50:45,375
Which were not justified and not not

3049
02:50:45,631 --> 02:50:46,143
Be funded

3050
02:50:46,399 --> 02:50:51,007
President Nixon and then President Ford to all of course said in those very interest

3051
02:50:51,263 --> 02:50:52,543
Christina and I really appreciate

3052
02:50:53,055 --> 02:50:54,079
The hard work you've

3053
02:50:54,335 --> 02:50:55,615
Want you to prepare this list but

3054
02:50:55,871 --> 02:50:57,919
No way am I going to do this and they reject

3055
02:51:00,735 --> 02:51:02,271
Politicians they knew how

3056
02:51:02,527 --> 02:51:06,367
The Congress operated in and President Carter was an outsid

3057
02:51:07,391 --> 02:51:11,743
Hi Jimmy Carter do sell them to swear when presidents come in and think that their

3058
02:51:13,535 --> 02:51:14,559
This is a serious

3059
02:51:14,815 --> 02:51:16,095
Steak they're only

3060
02:51:16,351 --> 02:51:17,375
One element of government

3061
02:51:18,143 --> 02:51:19,679
So Along Comes This

3062
02:51:19,935 --> 02:51:23,519
For repeated farmer and Governor ninja Carter who looks

3063
02:51:25,567 --> 02:51:27,615
Barely a month in office

3064
02:51:27,871 --> 02:51:31,967
Carter cut funds from 19 Western water projects under construction

3065
02:51:32,223 --> 02:51:34,015
Saying they were bad for the environment

3066
02:51:34,271 --> 02:51:35,295
I'm too expensive

3067
02:51:35,807 --> 02:51:36,831
Ladies and gentlemen

3068
02:51:37,343 --> 02:51:38,111
I give you the

3069
02:51:38,367 --> 02:51:39,135
Listen to the United States

3070
02:51:39,647 --> 02:51:41,439
President cart

3071
02:51:41,695 --> 02:51:42,719
They're

3072
02:51:42,975 --> 02:51:43,743
Night

3073
02:51:44,511 --> 02:51:45,279
In his office

3074
02:51:45,535 --> 02:51:47,583
Listen there were 12 advisors with him

3075
02:51:47,839 --> 02:51:48,607
You know all 12

3076
02:51:48,863 --> 02:51:49,375
So don't do this

3077
02:51:50,655 --> 02:51:53,727
And he voted he voted yes they all voted no and he went ahead and did it

3078
02:51:53,983 --> 02:51:55,007
No President Carter

3079
02:51:56,031 --> 02:51:58,079
There was a chip on his shoulder and a hit

3080
02:51:58,591 --> 02:51:59,103
Nice pocket

3081
02:51:59,871 --> 02:52:02,175
That he was going to stop a lot of

3082
02:52:03,967 --> 02:52:04,479
Project

3083
02:52:04,735 --> 02:52:09,599
Unnecessary it was the first time that any politician had taken a 2x4 and

3084
02:52:11,391 --> 02:52:13,695
Count the you know the donkey on top of the head

3085
02:52:13,951 --> 02:52:15,999
You're dealing here with projects in the

3086
02:52:16,255 --> 02:52:17,791
Central Arizona that go back

3087
02:52:18,047 --> 02:52:19,327
30 or 40 years

3088
02:52:20,095 --> 02:52:21,375
Thousands of hours

3089
02:52:21,631 --> 02:52:22,143
Of hear

3090
02:52:23,935 --> 02:52:24,959
Why why was

3091
02:52:25,215 --> 02:52:25,983
The decision

3092
02:52:26,495 --> 02:52:31,359
Let's take the money out of the budget why couldn't we announce that a review process was underway

3093
02:52:31,871 --> 02:52:32,383
It was

3094
02:52:32,639 --> 02:52:33,151
Like

3095
02:52:34,431 --> 02:52:37,503
It it struck the institution there were immediately

3096
02:52:38,015 --> 02:52:39,039
Meetings

3097
02:52:39,551 --> 02:52:40,575
Odd

3098
02:52:40,831 --> 02:52:41,855
How would the westerners

3099
02:52:43,391 --> 02:52:43,903
Wow the president

3100
02:52:44,415 --> 02:52:49,535
I would hope that we don't get to that point where there is a showdown at noon not

3101
02:52:49,791 --> 02:52:50,559
The Western

3102
02:52:51,327 --> 02:52:56,447
Either president been badly misinformed or his action demonstrates a callous disregard

3103
02:52:56,703 --> 02:52:59,007
For the welfare of the people of the states affected

3104
02:52:59,519 --> 02:53:00,031
Mastig

3105
02:53:00,543 --> 02:53:02,079
The Secretary of

3106
02:53:02,335 --> 02:53:02,847
This list

3107
02:53:03,103 --> 02:53:03,615
President

3108
02:53:03,871 --> 02:53:07,455
Sticking his nose and something that he didn't understand and didn't know

3109
02:53:07,711 --> 02:53:10,783
Didn't appreciate

3110
02:53:11,551 --> 02:53:15,391
That environmental concerns will not be the only thing

3111
02:53:16,415 --> 02:53:17,695
Which will be

3112
02:53:17,951 --> 02:53:19,487
Cranked into your investig

3113
02:53:19,999 --> 02:53:21,791
I mean clearly present Carter was right

3114
02:53:22,815 --> 02:53:23,583
These projects

3115
02:53:23,839 --> 02:53:24,607
When you looked at

3116
02:53:25,119 --> 02:53:26,143
We're completely

3117
02:53:27,167 --> 02:53:28,959
I complete waste of the taxpayers money

3118
02:53:29,471 --> 02:53:30,751
At one point I said

3119
02:53:32,031 --> 02:53:33,055
Yeah Mr secretary

3120
02:53:33,311 --> 02:53:35,103
I'm not sure this list is all bad

3121
02:53:35,615 --> 02:53:37,663
I think there's some projects here that that don't

3122
02:53:38,943 --> 02:53:39,455
And it was

3123
02:53:39,711 --> 02:53:40,479
Katana Brooks

3124
02:53:40,991 --> 02:53:47,135
Some of them are $168 million over authorized cost $192 million over

3125
02:53:47,647 --> 02:53:51,487
53 million 11 million 10 million

3126
02:53:51,743 --> 02:53:53,791
I think the review is Justified

3127
02:53:54,559 --> 02:53:56,351
People pulled your side in the hallway

3128
02:53:57,119 --> 02:53:57,887
You can't

3129
02:53:58,143 --> 02:53:59,423
You can't do this

3130
02:53:59,679 --> 02:54:00,703
We've got to stick together

3131
02:54:00,959 --> 02:54:01,983
We've got to hold together

3132
02:54:02,751 --> 02:54:04,031
This is an assault on all of

3133
02:54:04,287 --> 02:54:06,591
If they get my Water Project they're going to get your

3134
02:54:06,847 --> 02:54:08,895
I'm going to help

3135
02:54:09,407 --> 02:54:09,919
Your water project

3136
02:54:10,431 --> 02:54:11,199
This project

3137
02:54:11,455 --> 02:54:11,967
Need to be

3138
02:54:12,479 --> 02:54:16,319
I looked at very close to I personally don't believe in any of the projects ought to be built

3139
02:54:17,087 --> 02:54:18,111
But I'll keep an open mind

3140
02:54:19,135 --> 02:54:20,927
And it was the Bell that could not

3141
02:54:21,183 --> 02:54:21,695
Be on wrong

3142
02:54:22,207 --> 02:54:23,743
And it it sent out

3143
02:54:25,023 --> 02:54:25,535
A message

3144
02:54:26,047 --> 02:54:27,327
To other members of Congress

3145
02:54:27,583 --> 02:54:28,863
Who weren't from the West

3146
02:54:29,887 --> 02:54:30,655
That here was something

3147
02:54:31,167 --> 02:54:31,935
It was a mess

3148
02:54:32,447 --> 02:54:38,591
Here was a place if you wanted to go with it the waste of taxpayers money you could if you wanted to build your Environmental

3149
02:54:38,847 --> 02:54:39,871
You

3150
02:54:40,127 --> 02:54:41,151
For the present

3151
02:54:42,943 --> 02:54:43,711
For what he did

3152
02:54:43,967 --> 02:54:45,247
But he Chang

3153
02:54:45,759 --> 02:54:46,783
Again the entire

3154
02:54:47,039 --> 02:54:47,807
Political

3155
02:54:48,831 --> 02:54:49,855
Of all these dollars

3156
02:54:50,111 --> 02:54:51,391
Spent Water Project

3157
02:54:52,159 --> 02:54:53,183
Our symbol

3158
02:54:53,695 --> 02:54:55,487
There their symbols of

3159
02:54:55,743 --> 02:54:56,255
Of

3160
02:54:56,511 --> 02:54:58,047
That they're always something much larger

3161
02:54:58,303 --> 02:54:59,327
Larger than what they really are

3162
02:55:01,119 --> 02:55:07,263
In the end Carter could not stop

3163
02:55:09,823 --> 02:55:11,359
Nothing would ever be the same

3164
02:55:11,871 --> 02:55:18,015
He sent investigators to see what large-scale irrigation had achieved in the Westlands largest water district

3165
02:55:18,271 --> 02:55:18,783
In America

3166
02:55:22,111 --> 02:55:25,439
The Reclamation project that

3167
02:55:25,951 --> 02:55:26,463
To begin with

3168
02:55:27,487 --> 02:55:28,255
Visual

3169
02:55:28,511 --> 02:55:29,791
Family Farm

3170
02:55:30,047 --> 02:55:31,071
Of a sub

3171
02:55:31,839 --> 02:55:32,351
Nature

3172
02:55:32,607 --> 02:55:36,447
They didn't visualize Farms that were going to make enough money to send the

3173
02:55:36,703 --> 02:55:37,215
Used to college

3174
02:55:37,471 --> 02:55:38,751
You're even send them to attend

3175
02:55:39,775 --> 02:55:41,823
They visualize the farm that

3176
02:55:44,383 --> 02:55:45,151
Grow

3177
02:55:46,943 --> 02:55:49,247
And maybe a little Surplus say goodbye a bag

3178
02:55:49,503 --> 02:55:50,015
Salt

3179
02:55:53,087 --> 02:55:54,623
Those have

3180
02:55:54,879 --> 02:55:57,183
Dad had lived out here for many years

3181
02:55:57,439 --> 02:56:03,327
Had seen what happened to the homesteaders where they dried up and gone away it's 160 Acres was not

3182
02:56:04,607 --> 02:56:06,655
Was too small to be a viable

3183
02:56:07,679 --> 02:56:08,191
It was

3184
02:56:08,703 --> 02:56:10,751
Who's going to get the benefits of this Federal investment

3185
02:56:11,263 --> 02:56:12,799
Is it going to be rich guys

3186
02:56:13,055 --> 02:56:14,079
Going to be speculators

3187
02:56:14,335 --> 02:56:18,431
No we don't want that to happen we want it to be Farmers Family farmers

3188
02:56:18,943 --> 02:56:20,479
We end up in California

3189
02:56:21,503 --> 02:56:22,527
Where were irrigating

3190
02:56:24,831 --> 02:56:25,855
Do you even go back to

3191
02:56:27,391 --> 02:56:29,695
50 60,000 acres in a single holding

3192
02:56:30,463 --> 02:56:31,487
So is far different

3193
02:56:31,999 --> 02:56:35,583
What was visualized but 160th and limited in the 192 Act

3194
02:56:36,607 --> 02:56:42,751
There was not a single $160 Acre Farm in the Westlands Growers

3195
02:56:43,007 --> 02:56:45,311
In the government had been arguing since the beginning

3196
02:56:45,567 --> 02:56:49,407
Over when this thousand square miles would be broken into small farms

3197
02:56:50,687 --> 02:56:54,015
Now and owning 168 Acres

3198
02:56:54,271 --> 02:57:00,415
My wife could have 160 the husband can have 160 in it had 20 kids and if you had

3199
02:57:00,671 --> 02:57:02,719
An app Susie somewhere and you had

3200
02:57:02,975 --> 02:57:04,511
Been over here and there

3201
02:57:05,279 --> 02:57:07,071
You can see what began to happen

3202
02:57:07,327 --> 02:57:09,119
And we found ways to comply that

3203
02:57:09,375 --> 02:57:10,911
That we could make the econom

3204
02:57:11,167 --> 02:57:12,447
Next work and if it

3205
02:57:12,959 --> 02:57:16,543
You know creating some subsidiary organizations if it meant

3206
02:57:16,799 --> 02:57:20,127
Having your son have a 160 acres and you have 16 acre

3207
02:57:20,383 --> 02:57:22,431
You did that cuz that's what I took to survive it was

3208
02:57:22,687 --> 02:57:26,527
You know there was no big no kind of scheme to

3209
02:57:26,783 --> 02:57:27,295
Rip

3210
02:57:27,551 --> 02:57:28,063
The treasure is

3211
02:57:28,319 --> 02:57:29,599
No way to make things work

3212
02:57:29,855 --> 02:57:31,135
Local chamber of

3213
02:57:33,951 --> 02:57:40,095
It was together with the local Cattlemen's Association and the cotton growers association and we all

3214
02:57:40,351 --> 02:57:41,375
Who arrived at agreement

3215
02:57:41,887 --> 02:57:44,191
That you should spend the federal money to bring us the water

3216
02:57:47,007 --> 02:57:48,031
Hundreds of mill

3217
02:57:48,543 --> 02:57:49,055
Of dollars

3218
02:57:49,567 --> 02:57:50,335
Federal

3219
02:57:52,639 --> 02:57:54,943
And we bestowed it on a very

3220
02:57:55,199 --> 02:57:56,479
Small number of people

3221
02:57:58,015 --> 02:57:58,783
And we

3222
02:57:59,807 --> 02:58:00,575
With a prom

3223
02:58:01,855 --> 02:58:03,647
That they would break up their Farms

3224
02:58:04,415 --> 02:58:05,183
That they would

3225
02:58:05,695 --> 02:58:07,743
Provide rural communities throughout

3226
02:58:08,511 --> 02:58:09,791
And the large farm

3227
02:58:10,559 --> 02:58:14,655
I and their lawyers have the ability to to morph themselves into

3228
02:58:14,911 --> 02:58:17,215
Any size form that you wanted to make

3229
02:58:17,727 --> 02:58:23,871
Not only growing subsidized crops

3230
02:58:24,127 --> 02:58:28,223
But then they were receiving subsidized water to grow that subsidized crop

3231
02:58:28,735 --> 02:58:34,879
And the federal treasury was paying farmers in other parts of the country not to grow that crop these people had

3232
02:58:35,135 --> 02:58:35,903
Hundreds of ways

3233
02:58:36,159 --> 02:58:40,511
Skin the cat

3234
02:58:40,767 --> 02:58:46,399
They had predicted that there would be perhaps a 30 or 40% increase in agricultural productivity

3235
02:58:46,655 --> 02:58:52,799
And in fact over the first 10 years it had increased by 300%

3236
02:58:53,055 --> 02:58:59,199
Can we get that harvested the 7 days a week

3237
02:58:59,711 --> 02:59:00,991
16 hours a day

3238
02:59:01,247 --> 02:59:03,295
I work from 6:00 to

3239
02:59:04,063 --> 02:59:06,879
And then when the barley came 18 hours a day

3240
02:59:07,135 --> 02:59:08,159
We didn't know

3241
02:59:08,671 --> 02:59:09,695
Adele

3242
02:59:09,951 --> 02:59:10,975
The the first

3243
02:59:11,231 --> 02:59:13,023
The time that I went down to

3244
02:59:13,279 --> 02:59:16,095
Huron was the largest

3245
02:59:16,351 --> 02:59:21,215
Community that had lost its doctor didn't have a high school and didn't have a newspaper

3246
02:59:21,471 --> 02:59:27,615
There was one grocery store there were I think four bars of course everyone was living in very

3247
02:59:27,871 --> 02:59:30,943
Dilapidated rental housing the actual conditions

3248
02:59:31,199 --> 02:59:33,247
So we discovered the people were living under there

3249
02:59:33,759 --> 02:59:39,903
We're as bad or worse than the worst conditions that I've encountered in Africa South

3250
02:59:40,159 --> 02:59:43,487
The Sahara or Southern India or any parts of Latin America

3251
02:59:43,743 --> 02:59:47,583
The water out here it's always been a

3252
02:59:48,351 --> 02:59:49,375
And I say mister because

3253
02:59:49,887 --> 02:59:53,983
Without the water I mean you would would be in a desert sand right now

3254
02:59:54,495 --> 02:59:55,263
I mean that's what

3255
02:59:56,799 --> 03:00:02,943
The big corporate farmers who they are today but the fact that you know there is water out here in

3256
03:00:03,199 --> 03:00:09,343
Create jobs creates homes creates a wealth for the farmers not for the people

3257
03:00:09,599 --> 03:00:14,207
In Huron you know we've been fighting poverty for years and years and years and that's a

3258
03:00:14,463 --> 03:00:16,511
That's a demon that probably won't go away

3259
03:00:17,279 --> 03:00:23,423
In 1979 Carter's investigators found that Huron the largest town in the Westlands

3260
03:00:23,679 --> 03:00:26,495
Have become one of the poorest towns in California

3261
03:00:27,007 --> 03:00:32,127
The Spanish surname population of families were running 30% below the poverty level

3262
03:00:32,895 --> 03:00:36,991
Which is particularly striking in the context of zero unemployment

3263
03:00:37,247 --> 03:00:43,391
The the we couldn't find any evidence for unemployment in the region so that people were working these were people working

3264
03:00:43,647 --> 03:00:44,159
Very hard

3265
03:00:44,671 --> 03:00:46,975
How far be a below poverty wages

3266
03:00:47,231 --> 03:00:49,279
You know you can do a documentary and you can go out

3267
03:00:49,535 --> 03:00:52,351
Can say these people have a rough life they don't have a low income

3268
03:00:53,631 --> 03:00:57,215
But you can also live with them and work with them and know that they're happy people

3269
03:00:57,727 --> 03:01:01,567
Just like if you go to the third world the poorest people in the world

3270
03:01:02,335 --> 03:01:03,359
If they are

3271
03:01:03,615 --> 03:01:04,895
Adjusted and have

3272
03:01:05,407 --> 03:01:06,175
A way of life

3273
03:01:06,431 --> 03:01:09,503
That is fine way of life for them Mexican Americans

3274
03:01:09,759 --> 03:01:14,623
I found great work and and like the in some cases very well paying

3275
03:01:14,879 --> 03:01:21,023
Another case is pretty marginal but there's a way of life for them too driving a tractor is driving a tractor and it's outside

3276
03:01:21,535 --> 03:01:23,071
Better job than a lot of us have

3277
03:01:35,359 --> 03:01:41,503
For 2 weeks each

3278
03:01:41,759 --> 03:01:47,903
Bring in fall all the letters in America comes from the Westlands and every year enough cotton for a

3279
03:01:48,159 --> 03:01:54,047
Doing t-shirts my 1979

3280
03:01:54,303 --> 03:01:55,583
No place on Earth

3281
03:01:55,839 --> 03:01:57,119
I've been so changed

3282
03:01:57,375 --> 03:01:59,423
By the manipulation of water

3283
03:02:00,959 --> 03:02:06,847
Except in a few game Reser

3284
03:02:07,359 --> 03:02:10,431
Nearly all the valleys native fish in animals were gone

3285
03:02:11,967 --> 03:02:14,783
Much of the Sacramento River now irrigated crops

3286
03:02:15,807 --> 03:02:19,391
And the San Joaquin River sometimes flowed backwards

3287
03:02:21,951 --> 03:02:25,535
Chinook salmon were nearly extinct

3288
03:02:28,607 --> 03:02:29,631
The Crux of the

3289
03:02:31,167 --> 03:02:31,935
Salmon or people

3290
03:02:33,215 --> 03:02:33,983
No I'm sure people

3291
03:02:34,495 --> 03:02:35,519
Survive without salmon

3292
03:02:37,055 --> 03:02:37,823
But I don't think people

3293
03:02:38,335 --> 03:02:39,359
Survive without beans

3294
03:02:39,615 --> 03:02:40,127
Some potatoes

3295
03:02:40,383 --> 03:02:40,895
Using let

3296
03:02:41,151 --> 03:02:41,919
There was a run

3297
03:02:42,431 --> 03:02:43,711
A million to 2 million

3298
03:02:43,967 --> 03:02:46,783
I'm coming up in Sacramento River every year there were 21 canneries

3299
03:02:47,295 --> 03:02:48,319
In the Central Valley

3300
03:02:48,831 --> 03:02:50,367
There isn't any way to control the river

3301
03:02:50,879 --> 03:02:51,391
Without

3302
03:02:53,695 --> 03:02:54,719
And the salmon unfortun

3303
03:02:54,975 --> 03:02:58,047
Believe is one of the trade offs on the Sacramento River and on the Columbia River

3304
03:03:01,631 --> 03:03:03,423
I think it's worth it yes I think

3305
03:03:04,447 --> 03:03:05,983
They're substitutes for eating salmon

3306
03:03:09,567 --> 03:03:10,335
You can eat

3307
03:03:11,871 --> 03:03:14,175
In 1980

3308
03:03:14,431 --> 03:03:17,759
The Carter Administration was reviewing Growers water contracts

3309
03:03:18,271 --> 03:03:19,295
They were paying about

3310
03:03:19,551 --> 03:03:22,623
A quarter of what it cost to bring the water across California

3311
03:03:23,647 --> 03:03:25,695
President Carter running for re

3312
03:03:25,951 --> 03:03:29,791
Could have sent a strong message by questioning the price of water

3313
03:03:30,303 --> 03:03:32,351
Enforcing 168th and 11th

3314
03:03:32,607 --> 03:03:35,679
And demanding environmental changes in Western water policy

3315
03:03:37,215 --> 03:03:38,239
But suddenly

3316
03:03:38,495 --> 03:03:40,799
On the heels of a hostage crisis in Iran

3317
03:03:41,055 --> 03:03:43,871
Carter found himself in a race for his political life

3318
03:03:44,127 --> 03:03:45,407
Against Ronald reag

3319
03:03:45,919 --> 03:03:48,991
He turned to the San Joaquin Valley for campaign support

3320
03:03:55,903 --> 03:04:02,047
Carter and Congress chose not to change Western water policy

3321
03:04:06,911 --> 03:04:13,055
Need some money you'll land down there on one of those private Landings they have lunch for you walk out there $10,000 richer

3322
03:04:14,335 --> 03:04:15,871
And they buy another day

3323
03:04:16,127 --> 03:04:18,175
And that's what they're doing they're just playing for time

3324
03:04:20,479 --> 03:04:21,247
This is

3325
03:04:23,807 --> 03:04:24,575
You couldn't

3326
03:04:28,927 --> 03:04:35,071
But there was now public suspicion that something had

3327
03:04:35,327 --> 03:04:37,375
Gone terribly wrong amid the abundance

3328
03:04:38,655 --> 03:04:41,983
And an environmental Time Bomb was about to explode

3329
03:04:52,223 --> 03:04:56,319
Employees of the US fish and wildlife service have been doing this for months

3330
03:04:59,647 --> 03:05:02,975
Wildlife Refuge

3331
03:05:05,791 --> 03:05:09,119
For an individual who's been spending a lifetime trying to create habit

3332
03:05:09,631 --> 03:05:10,399
To

3333
03:05:12,191 --> 03:05:12,959
Try to move

3334
03:05:13,471 --> 03:05:13,983
The wild

3335
03:05:14,239 --> 03:05:16,031
Away from this habit that you've created

3336
03:05:16,287 --> 03:05:19,359
These traditions of the birds are very very difficult to

3337
03:05:20,383 --> 03:05:20,895
Impossible

3338
03:05:21,151 --> 03:05:22,943
Especially when once they've begun to nest

3339
03:05:23,455 --> 03:05:24,223
It was

3340
03:05:24,479 --> 03:05:30,623
It was a war zone out here

3341
03:05:32,159 --> 03:05:34,975
The fish and wildlife people refer to these mosquito fish

3342
03:05:35,231 --> 03:05:36,767
As little selenium tablets

3343
03:05:37,279 --> 03:05:38,815
See

3344
03:05:39,327 --> 03:05:39,839
From

3345
03:05:40,095 --> 03:05:40,863
Intensive

3346
03:05:41,119 --> 03:05:41,887
Farming and irrig

3347
03:05:43,167 --> 03:05:44,191
Deforming

3348
03:05:44,447 --> 03:05:45,983
Whatever tiny little

3349
03:05:46,239 --> 03:05:47,007
Museum pie

3350
03:05:47,263 --> 03:05:47,775
Use of

3351
03:05:48,031 --> 03:05:48,799
Nature were left

3352
03:05:50,591 --> 03:05:53,407
Runoff from Westlands Farms contain selenium

3353
03:05:54,175 --> 03:05:54,943
For years

3354
03:05:55,199 --> 03:05:58,527
Drainage had concentrated the selenium in the casterson ponds

3355
03:05:58,783 --> 03:06:01,599
Why would Bureau of Reclamation waited for a permit

3356
03:06:01,855 --> 03:06:04,671
To dump it into the San Francisco Bay and Delta

3357
03:06:04,927 --> 03:06:08,767
We went ahead with the Restless project

3358
03:06:09,023 --> 03:06:10,815
Or we saw the drainage problem

3359
03:06:11,071 --> 03:06:12,607
We thought we knew how to Sol

3360
03:06:13,119 --> 03:06:16,447
Probably thought the Kesterson Reservoir could be flushed on out

3361
03:06:16,703 --> 03:06:18,239
Delta we didn't have

3362
03:06:18,495 --> 03:06:20,031
Solid

3363
03:06:21,311 --> 03:06:22,079
So I made a

3364
03:06:22,335 --> 03:06:27,199
Steak by going ahead with Westlands at the time we did

3365
03:06:27,455 --> 03:06:31,295
But the problem begins on the farms and it winds up in the Refuge

3366
03:06:31,807 --> 03:06:37,951
Many young birds have been killed and deformed by high concentrations of selenium found in the

3367
03:06:38,975 --> 03:06:44,095
The very

3368
03:06:44,351 --> 03:06:48,447
Started features bills that were Twisted missing eyeballs

3369
03:06:48,703 --> 03:06:49,983
Bulges on the brain

3370
03:06:50,495 --> 03:06:51,519
Deformed feet

3371
03:06:51,775 --> 03:06:57,663
They remind me of the of the thalidomide babies that were over in in Europe

3372
03:06:58,175 --> 03:07:00,479
And his Mud Hens were up at this

3373
03:07:03,807 --> 03:07:05,855
Get it too much selenium and too much selenium

3374
03:07:14,815 --> 03:07:16,095
Exploded in her face

3375
03:07:16,351 --> 03:07:17,119
Bird deformities

3376
03:07:17,631 --> 03:07:18,399
What

3377
03:07:18,655 --> 03:07:19,423
Oliver

3378
03:07:19,935 --> 03:07:23,775
Attackers the proof they need that agriculture really is bad it does destroy the environment

3379
03:07:24,031 --> 03:07:25,567
Cuz we had some to form birds out there

3380
03:07:25,823 --> 03:07:26,847
Kesterson was approved

3381
03:07:27,103 --> 03:07:29,407
And we were the bad guys and it was really a turning point

3382
03:07:29,663 --> 03:07:31,455
And we would sit and struggle with

3383
03:07:31,967 --> 03:07:32,735
A photograph

3384
03:07:32,991 --> 03:07:33,759
Of a bird

3385
03:07:34,015 --> 03:07:35,295
Headline

3386
03:07:35,551 --> 03:07:40,159
On every newspaper and TV news every night you know about this crisis

3387
03:07:40,415 --> 03:07:42,719
At the end of irrigated agriculture in a million Acres

3388
03:07:42,975 --> 03:07:43,999
Going to go out of production

3389
03:07:44,511 --> 03:07:46,047
We cannot make a connection between

3390
03:07:46,303 --> 03:07:48,863
How do we solve this problem and how do we deal with this public

3391
03:07:49,119 --> 03:07:50,399
Crisis over here that was created

3392
03:07:50,911 --> 03:07:51,935
But for those mud

3393
03:07:52,447 --> 03:07:53,471
And but for those

3394
03:07:53,727 --> 03:07:55,007
Reservoir

3395
03:07:55,519 --> 03:07:58,591
Ah that plan eventually would have continued to creep on

3396
03:07:59,103 --> 03:08:01,151
But those are those Mud Hens

3397
03:08:03,711 --> 03:08:04,735
They really turned

3398
03:08:04,991 --> 03:08:06,271
The political history

3399
03:08:06,783 --> 03:08:08,319
Of other Central Valley Project

3400
03:08:09,087 --> 03:08:10,367
It was all adding up

3401
03:08:10,879 --> 03:08:11,903
Public anger at the

3402
03:08:12,159 --> 03:08:15,743
Congressional investigations in the water subsidies

3403
03:08:15,999 --> 03:08:17,535
Farm labor and salmon

3404
03:08:17,791 --> 03:08:19,583
And now the Last Straw

3405
03:08:20,095 --> 03:08:21,631
6 years of drought

3406
03:08:22,655 --> 03:08:24,447
Dust storms rake the valley

3407
03:08:24,703 --> 03:08:26,239
Trucks Bound for Market

3408
03:08:26,495 --> 03:08:30,591
Slammed into the biggest wreck in American history on Interstate 5

3409
03:08:30,847 --> 03:08:33,663
In the Westlands

3410
03:08:33,919 --> 03:08:35,711
Growers short on water

3411
03:08:35,967 --> 03:08:38,271
Let their fields go Barren and the Dust

3412
03:08:38,527 --> 03:08:42,879
Piled up waiting for strong winds to blow across the highway

3413
03:08:43,135 --> 03:08:44,415
Kind of moves us ahead

3414
03:08:44,671 --> 03:08:45,183
About

3415
03:08:45,439 --> 03:08:46,463
20 years in time

3416
03:08:46,719 --> 03:08:47,487
And all of a sudden

3417
03:08:47,743 --> 03:08:50,047
We have major shortages

3418
03:08:50,303 --> 03:08:51,839
Water was a lot like

3419
03:08:52,863 --> 03:08:54,399
That it was price responsive

3420
03:08:55,167 --> 03:08:57,727
And we we really had to do was attack

3421
03:08:58,239 --> 03:09:00,287
Subsidy and we became a nice Target

3422
03:09:00,543 --> 03:09:03,103
Subsidy issue fashioned in there there was a

3423
03:09:03,359 --> 03:09:04,383
All kinds of sex

3424
03:09:04,639 --> 03:09:06,431
Sexy political things that ways to beat us

3425
03:09:06,943 --> 03:09:07,967
Big slow moving Target

3426
03:09:08,223 --> 03:09:09,503
The areas of the country

3427
03:09:10,271 --> 03:09:16,415
Which have huge population growth on limited water resources are going to have to change the structure of their water usage

3428
03:09:16,671 --> 03:09:17,439
Going to have to become more

3429
03:09:17,951 --> 03:09:18,975
Conservation Orient

3430
03:09:19,487 --> 03:09:25,631
George Bush on the road on a roll he told the Valley Farmers

3431
03:09:31,775 --> 03:09:34,079
I don't believe we need the federal government

3432
03:09:34,335 --> 03:09:36,127
Getting into the water rights business

3433
03:09:37,663 --> 03:09:39,455
Bush was losing to Bill Clinton

3434
03:09:40,223 --> 03:09:45,087
Just before the election he signed a popular reform law in hopes of gaining electoral V

3435
03:09:48,159 --> 03:09:49,951
And for the first time in 50 years

3436
03:09:50,207 --> 03:09:51,487
Return water

3437
03:09:51,743 --> 03:09:52,767
Into the salmon stream

3438
03:09:54,047 --> 03:09:56,095
You were going to have to now pay for that water

3439
03:09:56,607 --> 03:09:58,911
And if you had to now pay for that water

3440
03:09:59,167 --> 03:10:02,239
You'd have to take into consideration other concerns

3441
03:10:02,751 --> 03:10:08,127
In terms of how you use that water how efficient you are the kinds of crops that you have to grow

3442
03:10:08,383 --> 03:10:11,711
When the law was changed when the project was redirected it was

3443
03:10:11,967 --> 03:10:13,503
You're a huge train wreck and

3444
03:10:14,271 --> 03:10:20,415
Cuz we've been chugging along doing great 50 years reliability project working good all this very stable farmers were not worried

3445
03:10:20,671 --> 03:10:23,999
In California until the drought because it was reliable

3446
03:10:24,255 --> 03:10:28,863
Now we've got new contracts and our water costs have gone from 350 which is a great deal for 40 years

3447
03:10:29,375 --> 03:10:30,399
To

3448
03:10:30,655 --> 03:10:32,447
5:45 an acre foot overnight

3449
03:10:33,215 --> 03:10:34,751
Huge swings in cost

3450
03:10:35,775 --> 03:10:37,823
The water has gotten more expensive

3451
03:10:38,079 --> 03:10:40,127
But really with a shortage of water and all we're paying

3452
03:10:43,199 --> 03:10:44,223
We need to make sure we

3453
03:10:44,479 --> 03:10:46,271
Don't use any more than absolutely

3454
03:10:49,855 --> 03:10:50,367
Expensive

3455
03:10:50,879 --> 03:10:51,391
But we're

3456
03:10:52,159 --> 03:10:52,671
I

3457
03:10:52,927 --> 03:10:56,767
This is got to be one of the most efficient uses of water there is

3458
03:10:58,047 --> 03:10:59,583
But it belongs to us don't it

3459
03:11:00,095 --> 03:11:00,863
The big canal

3460
03:11:01,119 --> 03:11:01,887
The tax

3461
03:11:02,911 --> 03:11:03,935
Did I see something wrong

3462
03:11:18,783 --> 03:11:24,927
In the year since the reform law there has been

3463
03:11:25,183 --> 03:11:26,207
Been a fragile peace

3464
03:11:28,255 --> 03:11:34,399
But the Great Central Valley will never be the same

3465
03:11:34,655 --> 03:11:38,751
Nearly all the corporate Farms have gone along with some smaller Farms

3466
03:11:41,055 --> 03:11:43,359
Native birds and Chinook salmon

3467
03:11:43,615 --> 03:11:45,663
Have begun a very slow comeback

3468
03:11:46,687 --> 03:11:48,479
The large Growers Who Remain

3469
03:11:48,735 --> 03:11:52,319
Are among the most productive and water efficient in the country

3470
03:11:52,831 --> 03:11:53,855
Producing more

3471
03:11:54,111 --> 03:11:54,879
With less water

3472
03:11:55,135 --> 03:11:57,439
No one will ever know

3473
03:11:57,951 --> 03:11:59,743
For the thousands of small farm

3474
03:12:00,255 --> 03:12:06,399
Could have done the same

3475
03:12:23,551 --> 03:12:29,695
Water

3476
03:12:29,951 --> 03:12:35,839
Is the essence of our existence without it there can be no

3477
03:12:55,039 --> 03:12:56,831
Civilizations began next

3478
03:12:57,087 --> 03:12:57,599
To order

3479
03:12:58,111 --> 03:13:03,487
But as populations grow

3480
03:13:04,255 --> 03:13:10,399
Especially an arid regions there is not enough to go around

3481
03:13:10,655 --> 03:13:16,799
I'm

3482
03:13:17,823 --> 03:13:19,615
Decisions about water have been

3483
03:13:19,871 --> 03:13:21,407
Guided by a very simple formula

3484
03:13:21,663 --> 03:13:22,175
Which

3485
03:13:22,431 --> 03:13:24,735
Estimate human demands for water

3486
03:13:24,991 --> 03:13:26,783
And build a new water project to meet it

3487
03:13:27,551 --> 03:13:31,135
And that equation was simple and it worked as long as water was abund

3488
03:13:31,903 --> 03:13:38,047
But it's not working anymore because water is becoming scarce

3489
03:13:38,303 --> 03:13:44,447
Concrete dams have dominated our management of water in the past 50 years

3490
03:13:44,703 --> 03:13:50,847
Dams tested and built to master the power of nature

3491
03:13:57,503 --> 03:14:03,647
The story of water has been the story of controlling it

3492
03:14:03,903 --> 03:14:10,047
38,000 large dams have been built in all dams to store water

3493
03:14:10,303 --> 03:14:16,447
And control plugs games for irrigation and hydroelectricity

3494
03:14:16,703 --> 03:14:21,311
Dams that have inundated canyons and drained wetland

3495
03:14:22,591 --> 03:14:24,127
Now

3496
03:14:24,383 --> 03:14:30,527
The damn building era in the United States is coming to a close the best sites are taken

3497
03:14:30,783 --> 03:14:33,855
The economic and environmental cost

3498
03:14:34,111 --> 03:14:35,135
Are too high

3499
03:14:35,391 --> 03:14:38,207
And Americans are beginning to turn

3500
03:14:38,463 --> 03:14:39,487
To conservation

3501
03:14:41,023 --> 03:14:44,095
But developing countries

3502
03:14:44,351 --> 03:14:50,495
To provide water and power for growing populations still covered these engineering Marvels

3503
03:14:50,751 --> 03:14:56,895
They sent their best and brightest to be trained by the Bureau of Reclamation

3504
03:14:57,151 --> 03:14:59,711
Builders of the super dams of the American West

3505
03:14:59,967 --> 03:15:06,111
Right after Hoover Dam

3506
03:15:06,367 --> 03:15:10,207
Much completed the world recognized that a great achievement is occur

3507
03:15:12,255 --> 03:15:14,047
Your Reclamation was bes

3508
03:15:15,327 --> 03:15:17,631
And we ended up as the training center

3509
03:15:17,887 --> 03:15:20,959
For young Engineers send here from Thailand

3510
03:15:21,215 --> 03:15:21,727
Turkey

3511
03:15:22,495 --> 03:15:24,543
Ethiopia all around the world

3512
03:15:26,079 --> 03:15:26,591
India

3513
03:15:26,847 --> 03:15:28,127
Was an example of

3514
03:15:28,639 --> 03:15:32,479
Everywhere I went in India they thought I was the second coming of the Buddha

3515
03:15:35,807 --> 03:15:37,087
More than any other Nation

3516
03:15:37,599 --> 03:15:40,415
India has staked its future on large Dam

3517
03:15:43,487 --> 03:15:45,023
In 1963

3518
03:15:45,535 --> 03:15:50,655
Prime minister nairu predicted that dams would become the temples of Modern India

3519
03:15:53,215 --> 03:15:53,727
Today

3520
03:15:56,799 --> 03:16:01,151
Have created electricity and supplied irrigation to feed the hungry subcontinent

3521
03:16:04,223 --> 03:16:06,783
But the dams have taken a heavy human to

3522
03:16:08,063 --> 03:16:10,623
Some 20 million people have lost their homes

3523
03:16:13,183 --> 03:16:17,279
In recent years a controversy has erupted over the damning of the name of the

3524
03:16:19,583 --> 03:16:23,423
I told my Nichols at Freddy's

3525
03:16:23,679 --> 03:16:26,751
Funny I'll go in the club

3526
03:16:27,007 --> 03:16:29,311
They look like

3527
03:16:30,079 --> 03:16:32,383
The weather

3528
03:16:42,879 --> 03:16:44,159
What about

3529
03:16:48,511 --> 03:16:53,375
Despite the damning of the narmada

3530
03:16:53,631 --> 03:16:56,191
Protesters have gone on math hunger strikes

3531
03:16:57,727 --> 03:17:00,031
Led by Major pad car

3532
03:17:00,287 --> 03:17:03,359
Members of the movement even threatened to drown themselves

3533
03:17:03,615 --> 03:17:08,223
The Verizon flood waters

3534
03:17:12,063 --> 03:17:13,343
Construction has stop

3535
03:17:14,111 --> 03:17:15,903
While the government reviews the project

3536
03:17:21,791 --> 03:17:22,559
So far

3537
03:17:23,071 --> 03:17:25,119
60 Villages have been inundated

3538
03:17:26,655 --> 03:17:28,703
It is unclear how India will proceed

3539
03:17:31,007 --> 03:17:37,151
A hemisphere away on the border between Argentina and

3540
03:17:37,407 --> 03:17:37,919
Paraguay

3541
03:17:47,135 --> 03:17:53,279
Biologists worry that the reservoir created by the dam will cause an outbreak of schistosomiasis

3542
03:17:54,303 --> 03:17:59,167
What's on call the disease of hydroelectric dams in the tropics

3543
03:18:00,959 --> 03:18:04,031
Feels like these breed in the stagnant reservoirs

3544
03:18:04,287 --> 03:18:10,175
Releasing a parasitic worm that penetrates human skin damaging the liver and spleen

3545
03:18:11,711 --> 03:18:15,295
People are not the only ones at risk

3546
03:18:15,551 --> 03:18:18,111
Has this region is flooded

3547
03:18:18,623 --> 03:18:24,767
70 kinds of mammals and 300 bird species will lose their home

3548
03:18:25,023 --> 03:18:31,167
Can a region where rainforest habitat is rapidly disappearing

3549
03:18:37,567 --> 03:18:43,711
Efforts to rescue some of the larger animals rarely succeed

3550
03:18:50,367 --> 03:18:56,511
Many will die from the stresses of capture

3551
03:19:08,799 --> 03:19:14,687
Where the damn building era is really going a gangbusters now is in countries like Indonesia

3552
03:19:15,199 --> 03:19:15,711
China

3553
03:19:16,223 --> 03:19:17,759
Malaysia Brazil

3554
03:19:18,015 --> 03:19:20,319
Other South American countries Chile

3555
03:19:21,087 --> 03:19:21,855
Some of the

3556
03:19:22,879 --> 03:19:24,415
Most beautiful River

3557
03:19:24,671 --> 03:19:25,183
It

3558
03:19:25,439 --> 03:19:26,975
The planet I know being

3559
03:19:27,231 --> 03:19:27,999
Turned in the res

3560
03:19:28,767 --> 03:19:30,303
And some of the biggest dam

3561
03:19:30,559 --> 03:19:32,351
Ever build bigger than anything but we've

3562
03:19:32,607 --> 03:19:33,375
Are being

3563
03:19:33,631 --> 03:19:39,775
Southern countries like Brazil and China

3564
03:19:40,031 --> 03:19:41,823
Want to build three gorgeous Dam

3565
03:19:42,079 --> 03:19:44,639
The world's largest hydroelectric project

3566
03:19:44,895 --> 03:19:47,967
Eventually Rising 600 ft High

3567
03:19:48,223 --> 03:19:49,759
And over a mile wide

3568
03:19:50,271 --> 03:19:52,319
The demo create an enormous Lake

3569
03:19:52,575 --> 03:19:53,599
That will stretch nearly

3570
03:19:53,855 --> 03:19:55,647
400 Mi Upstream

3571
03:19:55,903 --> 03:20:02,047
China's leaders say three gorgeous will fuel its industrial Rev

3572
03:20:02,303 --> 03:20:07,167
And save millions of people from frequent floods along the Yankee River

3573
03:20:08,703 --> 03:20:14,847
What is the Finish is going to be the largest time in the world it was Supply 1/10 of your electricity for China

3574
03:20:15,103 --> 03:20:21,247
Critics of three gorgeous say the project will create a 30 billion

3575
03:20:21,503 --> 03:20:22,015
Dollar Bo

3576
03:20:22,527 --> 03:20:23,295
Because

3577
03:20:23,551 --> 03:20:25,087
Multiple build up behind the dance

3578
03:20:29,439 --> 03:20:33,535
The project will flood the nation's most beautiful region

3579
03:20:34,047 --> 03:20:37,631
As famous in China as the Grand Canyon is in the US

3580
03:20:38,143 --> 03:20:44,287
Over

3581
03:20:44,543 --> 03:20:50,687
Million people in Riverside villages will be displaced

3582
03:20:50,943 --> 03:20:57,087
Even the World Bank longest supporter of large dams has withdrawn from Three Gorges

3583
03:20:57,343 --> 03:21:03,487
But China says it will go ahead and find its own financing

3584
03:21:05,535 --> 03:21:07,583
In late 1993

3585
03:21:08,095 --> 03:21:08,863
Dan beard

3586
03:21:09,119 --> 03:21:11,423
Then chief of the US Bureau of Reclamation

3587
03:21:11,679 --> 03:21:14,751
Withdrew his agency's technical support for Three Gorges

3588
03:21:16,543 --> 03:21:17,823
There's no better example

3589
03:21:18,335 --> 03:21:20,127
Of project we shouldn't be involved

3590
03:21:20,639 --> 03:21:21,407
Country gorgeous Dam

3591
03:21:21,919 --> 03:21:23,711
We've moved away from Water Project

3592
03:21:23,967 --> 03:21:25,759
Construction in the United States and I

3593
03:21:27,039 --> 03:21:27,551
For

3594
03:21:27,807 --> 03:21:29,343
Continue to be involved in the largest

3595
03:21:29,599 --> 03:21:31,135
Damn construction project in the world

3596
03:21:31,903 --> 03:21:32,927
There are better

3597
03:21:33,439 --> 03:21:34,975
Easier and cheaper way

3598
03:21:35,231 --> 03:21:35,743
Solve

3599
03:21:35,999 --> 03:21:36,767
The problems of

3600
03:21:37,023 --> 03:21:37,535
Control and

3601
03:21:38,303 --> 03:21:39,327
The three gorgeous amp

3602
03:21:40,607 --> 03:21:42,655
Moving from large construction projects

3603
03:21:42,911 --> 03:21:44,703
To a culture of conservation

3604
03:21:44,959 --> 03:21:48,031
Requires a major change in the way people think about water

3605
03:21:51,871 --> 03:21:55,455
And many developing countries face staggering problems

3606
03:21:55,711 --> 03:21:57,247
I both water quality

3607
03:21:57,503 --> 03:21:58,527
And water

3608
03:22:06,975 --> 03:22:13,119
Mexico

3609
03:22:14,143 --> 03:22:20,287
Struggling now to provide water for 20 million people

3610
03:22:20,543 --> 03:22:23,615
Predicted to grow by another 10 million in the next decade

3611
03:22:25,663 --> 03:22:27,711
Just wear the water will come from

3612
03:22:27,967 --> 03:22:34,111
Remains an open question

3613
03:22:34,367 --> 03:22:39,743
Originally built on a system of five lakes

3614
03:22:39,999 --> 03:22:43,071
Mexico City began its history rich in water

3615
03:22:43,327 --> 03:22:49,471
He has text once

3616
03:22:49,727 --> 03:22:51,775
Holding Fields along these canals

3617
03:22:52,031 --> 03:22:58,175
This is all that remains of those Lakes

3618
03:22:58,431 --> 03:23:00,991
Today

3619
03:23:01,247 --> 03:23:05,087
3/4 of Mexico City's population enjoys modern plumbing

3620
03:23:05,343 --> 03:23:08,927
And plenty of water for drinking showers and sanitation

3621
03:23:11,999 --> 03:23:13,279
But

3622
03:23:13,535 --> 03:23:15,071
Brawling Shanty towns

3623
03:23:15,327 --> 03:23:17,375
Migrants from rural areas

3624
03:23:17,631 --> 03:23:18,143
Water

3625
03:23:18,399 --> 03:23:19,167
Or even the most

3626
03:23:19,423 --> 03:23:20,703
Basic human needs

3627
03:23:23,263 --> 03:23:25,055
Mexico City faces

3628
03:23:25,311 --> 03:23:26,847
One of the most difficult

3629
03:23:27,103 --> 03:23:30,431
Challenges of any urban area in the world with regard to water

3630
03:23:30,943 --> 03:23:33,759
18 to 20 million people living in

3631
03:23:34,015 --> 03:23:37,343
I'm very very densely populated area

3632
03:23:37,855 --> 03:23:41,951
The next best news source of water is a thousand meters below the city

3633
03:23:42,207 --> 03:23:45,791
They're very dependent on groundwater and already over pumping

3634
03:23:46,047 --> 03:23:47,327
That groundwater

3635
03:23:47,583 --> 03:23:48,863
On the order of 50 to 80

3636
03:23:49,119 --> 03:23:49,631

One quarter of

3643
03:24:29,823 --> 03:24:35,967
University's water must be pumped in from 100 miles away

3644
03:24:36,223 --> 03:24:42,367
With Antiquated pipes damaged by subsidence and earthquakes

3645
03:24:42,623 --> 03:24:48,767
The city loses almost a third of its water to leaks which is a common problem

03:24:49,023 --> 03:24:55,167
Around the world for cities with aging pipes

3647

Still celebrates its long love affair with water

3648
03:25:06,943 --> 03:25:09,503
But there's a terrible irony in the way

3649
03:25:09,759 --> 03:25:14,111
And poor people get their water for the well to do

3650
03:25:14,367 --> 03:25:20,511
Piped in water is cheap and plentiful for the poor water is

3651
03:25:20,767 --> 03:25:26,911
Very expensive and hard to come by

3652
03:25:27,167 --> 03:25:29,215
Circle City has a growing population

3653
03:25:29,471 --> 03:25:33,567
A lot of people are coming in from outside to the city and

3654
03:25:33,823 --> 03:25:36,639
For the city it's very difficult to provide them with services

3655
03:25:37,663 --> 03:25:39,199
In the

3656
03:25:39,711 --> 03:25:45,855

Residents were promised piped in Water by local politicians

3662
03:26:05,055 --> 03:26:06,335
But so far

3663
03:26:06,591 --> 03:26:08,127
They have received no services

3664
03:26:09,407 --> 03:26:14,015

Following the recent outbreak of color that claimed lives all over Latin America

3681
03:28:15,615 --> 03:28:21,759
Mexico City launched a campaign urging people to boil their drinking water and to wash their hands after going to

Into the bathroom

3683
03:28:24,575 --> 03:28:28,927
80% of illnesses in developing countries can be traced to unsafe water

3684
03:28:29,183 --> 03:28:33,279
And poor Sanitation

3685
03:28:33,535 --> 03:28:39,679
Over a billion people in the world don't have

3686
03:28:39,935 --> 03:28:44,031
Have access even to basic drinking water and sanitation requirements

3687

The drinking water needs the food needs the industrial needs of a population growing that fast is extremely difficult

3694
03:29:04,255 --> 03:29:06,303
And many of these countries are already

Water short

3696
03:29:07,839 --> 03:29:12,703
The nations of the Middle East

3697
03:29:12,959 --> 03:29:16,287
Are already hitting the limits of their renewable Water Supplies

3698
03:29:16,543 --> 03:29:22,687
With populations predicted to double in 30 years the Israelis Jordan

For urban and Industrial use with little freshwater to grow food

3700
03:29:31,903 --> 03:29:38,047
These people's realized that if they don't cooperate to share their limited Water Resources

3701
03:29:38,303 --> 03:29:39,839
It may mean War

3702
03:29:43,935 --> 03:29:50,079
Israel has had long running disputes with Jordan Syria and Lebanon over

3703
03:29:50,335 --> 03:29:50,847
For the rights

Hostilities between the Israelis and the Palestinians over land

3705
03:29:58,527 --> 03:30:04,671
Have run high for decades but less well known is the fact that Israel draws one quarter

3706
03:30:04,927 --> 03:30:11,071
Water from the occupied territories

3707
03:30:11,327 --> 03:30:17,471
Resolving water disputes will require not only diplomacy but new technologies that can make

3708
03:30:17,727 --> 03:30:23,871
Make the most of the Region's limited Supply

3709
03:30:24,127 --> 03:30:30,271
Israel is building hundreds of Apartments blocks to accommodate a large

3711
03:30:36,415 --> 03:30:42,559
To meet it's growing needs Israel is depending more and more on recycled

3712
03:30:42,815 --> 03:30:46,399
We recycle reuse

3713
03:30:47,167 --> 03:30:47,935

You have to learn how to launder

3716
03:30:52,031 --> 03:30:56,127
As more fresh water is diverted to cities

3717
03:30:56,639 --> 03:31:00,479
Recycled water is the only source that actually grows with population

3718
03:31:01,247 --> 03:31:07,391
It's the shadow of the supply Israel now Rec

3719
03:31:07,647 --> 03:31:08,927
= 2/3 of its water

3720
03:31:09,695 --> 03:31:12,767
This facility handles the Wastewater of Seven Cities

3721
03:31:14,815 --> 03:31:17,887
Reclaimed water gets used in Cooling in sanitation system

Recycled water is also

3725
03:31:30,175 --> 03:31:31,199
To irrigate

3726
03:31:33,503 --> 03:31:35,039
Now at first the farmers were

3727
03:31:35,295 --> 03:31:37,087
Farmers are usually pretty conservative

3728
03:31:37,599 --> 03:31:41,439
But as time went on and particularly during the drought in 1991

3729
03:31:42,463 --> 03:31:46,047
Wastewater became a very sought after Resort why

3730
03:31:46,559 --> 03:31:50,143
Because when the Sweetwater sources were in short supply

3731
03:31:50,399 --> 03:31:51,679
The Wastewater was there

3732
03:31:51,935 --> 03:31:53,983
And the farmers were clamoring to connect up

3733
03:31:54,239 --> 03:31:56,031
To the Wastewater we use the project

3734
03:31:56,287 --> 03:32:02,431
In the blistering heat of the negative

3735
03:32:02,687 --> 03:32:08,831
Israeli Farmers have created an agricultural Miracle pioneering the use of

3736
03:32:09,087 --> 03:32:13,183
Irrigation they have double their harvests with the same amount of water

3737
03:32:14,207 --> 03:32:20,351
Perforated tubes deliver water directly to the roots of the plants avoid

3738
03:32:20,607 --> 03:32:21,887
Wedding evaporation losses

3739
03:32:22,143 --> 03:32:28,287
Moisture sensors tell Farmers precisely when their crops need water drip techn

3740
03:32:28,543 --> 03:32:34,687
Apology can save a third of the water used in spray methods however

3741
03:32:41,343 --> 03:32:44,415
Tell us that irrigation has periods like

3742
03:32:44,671 --> 03:32:46,207
In the life of a married couple

3743
03:32:46,719 --> 03:32:49,535
There is the honeymoon between the irrigator

3744
03:32:49,791 --> 03:32:50,559
And the

3745
03:32:51,071 --> 03:32:51,839
And this happens

3746
03:32:52,351 --> 03:32:54,143
In the beginning like most animals

3747
03:32:54,655 --> 03:32:56,959
And after some decad

3748
03:32:57,471 --> 03:32:58,495
There is

3749
03:32:58,751 --> 03:33:01,567
Increasing the deterioration of the land

3750
03:33:01,823 --> 03:33:07,967
As a result of irrigation South brought in by irrigation water concentr

3751
03:33:08,223 --> 03:33:08,735

Damaging it's fertility

3753
03:33:14,111 --> 03:33:16,159
Story for example is

03:33:16,415 --> 03:33:18,975
The federal Crescent Iraq of these days

3755
03:33:19,231 --> 03:33:21,023
Will thousands of fields ago

3756
03:33:21,279 --> 03:33:23,071
Irrigation was used

3757
03:33:23,327 --> 03:33:28,959
But the land deteriorated and some of it is as still not recovered from this bad experience

3758
03:33:29,215 --> 03:33:35,359
With human irrigation similar processes are now starting to be seen in every IR

3759
03:33:35,615 --> 03:33:37,151
Get the direction all over the world

3760
03:33:37,663 --> 03:33:38,943

Show the Mediterranean region to Australia China India and South America

3762

One Salt build up

3763
03:33:47,135 --> 03:33:48,415
They must be flushed out

3764
03:33:48,671 --> 03:33:49,951
With even more water

3765
03:33:51,487 --> 03:33:53,279
So over the course of generations

3766
03:33:53,791 --> 03:33:56,351
There are limits to how much water can be cons

3767
03:33:56,863 --> 03:34:03,007
The power to remove salt from ocean water has long been a dream

3768
03:34:03,263 --> 03:34:09,407
Promising almost Limitless water for human needs

3769
03:34:09,663 --> 03:34:15,807
Desalinated water is already serving some urban populations those that can afford a high price

3770
03:34:16,063 --> 03:34:22,207
But it's unlikely in the foreseeable future to be cheap enough for you in agriculture

3771
03:34:22,463 --> 03:34:28,607
The problem with desalination is that it's very energy intensive it takes a lot of

3772
03:34:28,863 --> 03:34:30,911
Energy to remove salt from water

3773
03:34:31,423 --> 03:34:32,959
So at the moment

3774
03:34:33,215 --> 03:34:37,055
Most of the desalination that's happening in the world is in the Persian Gulf

3775
03:34:38,335 --> 03:34:39,871
Saudi Arabia Kuwait

3776
03:34:40,127 --> 03:34:42,175
United Arab Emirates they account for about

3777
03:34:42,431 --> 03:34:46,527
Half of all the desalination that's happening even though they have only a tiny share

3778
03:34:46,783 --> 03:34:47,807
Of the world's population

3779
03:34:48,319 --> 03:34:54,463
They're essentially turning oil into water and they're among the few countries that can afford to do that

3780
03:35:01,119 --> 03:35:07,263
Disputes over water in the Middle East go back

3781
03:35:07,519 --> 03:35:08,287
A long way

3782
03:35:09,823 --> 03:35:15,967
According to the Bible the wells in the land of the Philistines were called hatred and

3783
03:35:23,903 --> 03:35:30,047
In Gaza and on the West Bank of the

3784
03:35:30,303 --> 03:35:30,815
Gordon River

3785
03:35:31,327 --> 03:35:34,399
Israel provides piped in water to Israeli settlers

3786
03:35:34,655 --> 03:35:39,519
Wild Palestinian citizens have received a more limited Supply

3787
03:35:42,847 --> 03:35:45,663
When it comes to military occupation

3788
03:35:47,199 --> 03:35:48,991
And famous they don't go together

3789
03:35:50,783 --> 03:35:52,831
If the current situation continues

3790
03:35:53,087 --> 03:35:54,879
I see the Palestinian

03:35:55,135 --> 03:35:55,903
Honey

3792
03:35:56,159 --> 03:35:57,183
And what that can

3793
03:35:58,719 --> 03:36:00,511
Already we see signs of

3794
03:36:01,535 --> 03:36:02,815
Where kidney fail

3795
03:36:03,071 --> 03:36:04,095
As a result of

3796
03:36:05,887 --> 03:36:06,655
Freshwater

3797
03:36:07,167 --> 03:36:09,471
And unsafe and polluted water

3798
03:36:10,751 --> 03:36:12,031
This cannot continue

3799
03:36:12,287 --> 03:36:12,799
This is

3800
03:36:13,311 --> 03:36:14,335
A recipe

In most Palestinian homes

03:36:21,503 --> 03:36:26,111
Rainwater is collected and stored in cisterns below ground

Each system

An expensive investment for families who only earn half that in a year

3807
03:36:36,863 --> 03:36:40,191
Is Hitler in the West Bank consume seven times more

3808

Not going to see me

03:36:41,983 --> 03:36:42,495
End

3810
03:36:43,263 --> 03:36:44,799
And in Gaza they consum

3811
03:36:45,311 --> 03:36:46,591
14 times more

3812
03:36:47,871 --> 03:36:49,407
This is a source

03:36:49,663 --> 03:36:50,175
In

3814
03:36:51,199 --> 03:36:52,223
Which is causing

3815
03:36:52,479 --> 03:36:54,527
Money for the students to ask why

3816
03:36:55,551 --> 03:36:57,087
We need to have water

3817
03:36:57,599 --> 03:37:00,415
Our children doing water exactly like crazy chicken

3818
03:37:02,719 --> 03:37:07,071
Of all the people in the Middle East the Palestinians are those

3819
03:37:07,327 --> 03:37:08,095
Most

3820
03:37:09,375 --> 03:37:11,935
And I as an Israeli would like to say that

3821
03:37:12,447 --> 03:37:13,727
Without getting into the amount

3822
03:37:13,983 --> 03:37:15,007
Of water that are

3823
03:37:15,263 --> 03:37:15,775
Discussion

3824
03:37:16,031 --> 03:37:18,079
It should be in Israel's interest

3825
03:37:18,335 --> 03:37:19,103
To see you

3826
03:37:19,359 --> 03:37:20,127
Did the Palestinian

3827
03:37:20,639 --> 03:37:21,407
Get a fair deal

3828
03:37:21,919 --> 03:37:24,479
And get enough water so they feel comfortable for the future

3829
03:37:24,735 --> 03:37:27,807
It's in Israel's interest to live in peace with its neighbors

3830
03:37:29,855 --> 03:37:35,999
I think the potential for conflict is going to persist until we see water sharing agreements that

3831
03:37:36,255 --> 03:37:40,607
Buy the water equitably in each of the major river basins in the Middle East and elsewhere

3832
03:37:41,631 --> 03:37:44,703
We're beginning to see countries realize that they have

3833
03:37:45,727 --> 03:37:48,799
Benefits to gain from from cooperating and

3834
03:37:49,311 --> 03:37:51,871
If they continue to see that we could see water

3835
03:37:52,127 --> 03:37:55,455
And water scarcity become a motivation for peace rather than War

3836
03:37:58,271 --> 03:37:59,551
Half a world away

3837
03:37:59,807 --> 03:38:04,159
The tug of war over water goes on in the Arid American West

3838
03:38:07,231 --> 03:38:13,375
There's a lust for water here that borders on obsession

3839
03:38:13,631 --> 03:38:14,399
Get free time

3840
03:38:14,655 --> 03:38:20,287
They had for the nearest water they can find rivers pools

3841
03:38:20,543 --> 03:38:21,567
Artificial Lakes

3842
03:38:22,335 --> 03:38:24,127
There are no natural lakes here

3843
03:38:24,895 --> 03:38:31,039
Water from the Colorado River has transformed the desert into the fastest growing

3844
03:38:31,295 --> 03:38:32,063
Region of the country

3845
03:38:34,367 --> 03:38:36,671
10 major dams stop up the river

3846
03:38:36,927 --> 03:38:40,767
And Canal siphon off water for irrigation and growing cities

3847
03:38:41,791 --> 03:38:46,399
Most of these water projects were constructed before the 1960s and seventies

3848
03:38:46,655 --> 03:38:48,191
When things begin to change

3849
03:38:52,031 --> 03:38:52,543
Project

3850
03:38:52,799 --> 03:38:53,567
Before

3851
03:38:53,823 --> 03:38:54,591
We're built with

3852
03:38:54,847 --> 03:38:57,151
Almost no environmental consideration at all

3853
03:38:57,663 --> 03:39:02,015
And then finally The Endangered Species Act the National Environmental Policy I came along

3854
03:39:03,039 --> 03:39:04,319
And those allow

3855
03:39:04,575 --> 03:39:05,599
The public into the

3856
03:39:06,367 --> 03:39:07,135
And then

3857
03:39:07,391 --> 03:39:08,415
Began to get out

3858
03:39:09,439 --> 03:39:10,975
The best sites have been taken

3859
03:39:11,487 --> 03:39:13,535
And so the newer dance were

3860
03:39:13,791 --> 03:39:16,863
Much more expensive for the equivalent amount of water that you might get out

3861
03:39:17,631 --> 03:39:19,935
And essentially as the country

3862
03:39:20,191 --> 03:39:22,239
A master greater and greater Federal

3863
03:39:23,007 --> 03:39:24,543
People began to say wait a minute

3864
03:39:25,055 --> 03:39:28,127
Why are we building billion dollar dams when I have to do

3865
03:39:28,383 --> 03:39:31,967
Conserve some water and you can get just as much with conservation as you would with the supply

3866
03:39:34,271 --> 03:39:38,111
The city of Denver was forced to put these new realities to the test

3867
03:39:39,135 --> 03:39:45,279
In 1982 the water board filed application to build two forks

3868
03:39:45,791 --> 03:39:50,655
River

3869
03:39:50,911 --> 03:39:57,055
In the midst of a growth boom

3870
03:39:57,311 --> 03:40:00,383
Future

3871
03:40:00,639 --> 03:40:06,527
What city officials didn't anticipate was an overwhelming protest

3872
03:40:06,783 --> 03:40:10,111
From environmental groups fisherman biologist

3873
03:40:10,367 --> 03:40:13,695
An ordinary citizens

3874
03:40:13,951 --> 03:40:16,511
It really was the last dance

3875
03:40:16,767 --> 03:40:17,791
Of the dinosaurs

3876
03:40:18,303 --> 03:40:18,815
It was

3877
03:40:19,327 --> 03:40:20,351
Developed in an ER

3878
03:40:20,607 --> 03:40:21,631
When we thought

3879
03:40:21,887 --> 03:40:25,983
About water only is its value and being taken from the Stream

3880
03:40:26,239 --> 03:40:27,263
To supply

3881
03:40:28,287 --> 03:40:29,823
And to supply agriculture

3882
03:40:30,079 --> 03:40:34,175
We're now in the mode where we think about water in its natural course

3883
03:40:34,431 --> 03:40:36,479
Is valuable in its own right

3884
03:40:38,271 --> 03:40:44,415
Two books damn was to be located 25 miles

3885
03:40:44,671 --> 03:40:50,815
From Denver on the South Platte River it was flood a 28 mile

3886
03:40:51,071 --> 03:40:51,583
Richard land

3887
03:40:51,839 --> 03:40:53,631
Including Cheeseman Canyon

3888
03:40:53,887 --> 03:40:55,423
And a prime trout Fishery

3889
03:40:59,007 --> 03:41:00,799
You can't understand

3890
03:41:01,311 --> 03:41:06,687
What a damn does and put a reservoir is unless you've been there before

3891
03:41:06,943 --> 03:41:07,967
The construction

3892
03:41:08,223 --> 03:41:12,831
And if you go out to two forks what you find is the narrowing of a

3893
03:41:13,087 --> 03:41:13,599
Can

3894
03:41:14,367 --> 03:41:16,927
A very efficient place to put in a

3895
03:41:17,183 --> 03:41:19,231
60 story high cement

3896
03:41:20,511 --> 03:41:23,071
But it is a place you don't want to lose

3897
03:41:24,095 --> 03:41:25,375
And people went there

3898
03:41:25,631 --> 03:41:30,239
And they spoke out in different ways and said we don't want to lose that place

3899
03:41:31,519 --> 03:41:33,823
There was more than Cheeseman Canyon at stake

3900
03:41:34,847 --> 03:41:37,407
The Platte River flows north into Nebraska

3901
03:41:39,199 --> 03:41:43,551
Biologist worried that two forks stand with pirate the Platte rivers flow

3902
03:41:45,087 --> 03:41:47,647
Strangling with land habitat for migratory bird

3903
03:41:50,207 --> 03:41:56,351
All around us right now we're hearing the sound of the Santo cranes that visit the plot

3904
03:41:56,607 --> 03:41:59,167
Every Spring as part of the

3905
03:41:59,423 --> 03:42:02,495
Greatest migration of cranes that occurs on face of the Earth

3906
03:42:03,263 --> 03:42:09,407
They gather on this River in numbers that are truly astounding half a million Santo cranes

3907
03:42:09,663 --> 03:42:15,807
Rather hear each spring if you're in central Nebraska

3908
03:42:16,063 --> 03:42:22,207
The perfect combination of flowing water a shallow River Fields of food for them to eat

3909
03:42:22,719 --> 03:42:25,791
And in this Gathering we have

3910
03:42:26,047 --> 03:42:27,839
One of the greatest spectacles in North America

3911
03:42:28,095 --> 03:42:34,239
And people come here from all over the country and all around the world to see this event because it's unmatched anywhere else

3912
03:42:35,263 --> 03:42:39,359
Bands of Empire not

3913
03:42:39,615 --> 03:42:40,639
Upstream in the area

3914
03:42:40,895 --> 03:42:41,919
It's flooded by a reservoir

3915
03:42:42,175 --> 03:42:42,687
But

3916
03:42:42,943 --> 03:42:44,735
Strength throughout the entire system where

3917
03:42:45,247 --> 03:42:47,295
The blockage of flow

3918
03:42:47,551 --> 03:42:53,695
Alters the way the river flows Downstream and can alter the habitats of differently

3919
03:42:53,951 --> 03:42:59,071
The Platte River used to be over a mile wide

3920
03:42:59,583 --> 03:43:02,911
Today diversions for irrigation have reduced

3921
03:43:03,167 --> 03:43:04,703
Flow by 70%

3922
03:43:05,727 --> 03:43:11,871
Squeezing migratory Birds into smaller and smaller areas of habitat

3923
03:43:12,127 --> 03:43:16,223
Pounds and communities along the

3924
03:43:16,479 --> 03:43:22,367
Have finally come to the realization that the kinds of clothes they need staying drinking water supplies

3925
03:43:22,623 --> 03:43:25,951
And to just generally provide for a healthy human environment

3926
03:43:26,207 --> 03:43:30,303
A very similar to the kinds of clothes that we've been saying are needed to sustain an

3927
03:43:30,559 --> 03:43:36,447
So in a very real sense

3928
03:43:36,959 --> 03:43:38,751
What happens to the cranes

3929
03:43:39,007 --> 03:43:42,847
Is indication of what's happening to us and the human Community here on the flat

3930
03:43:43,103 --> 03:43:49,247
Still the question remain

3931
03:43:49,503 --> 03:43:52,319
How to provide for Denver's growth

3932
03:43:53,343 --> 03:43:59,487
As the debate over two forks rage done Denver spent 45

3933
03:44:02,815 --> 03:44:07,679
But at the 11th Hour

3934
03:44:14,335 --> 03:44:15,103
All in all

3935
03:44:15,359 --> 03:44:17,151
We were able to demonstrate

3936
03:44:17,663 --> 03:44:18,943
That you could Supply

3937
03:44:19,455 --> 03:44:21,503
20% more water than two forks

3938
03:44:22,527 --> 03:44:23,039
The cost

3939
03:44:23,295 --> 03:44:23,807
Two

3940
03:44:24,063 --> 03:44:24,575
And

3941
03:44:27,135 --> 03:44:28,159
The environmental damage

3942
03:44:29,183 --> 03:44:29,951
When

3943
03:44:30,207 --> 03:44:36,351
Cities have expensive capital projects to look at you can almost always demonstrate conservation

3944
03:44:36,607 --> 03:44:37,119
Makes more sense

3945
03:44:37,631 --> 03:44:38,655
Building a new project

3946
03:44:50,175 --> 03:44:56,319
Hot water for our cities and hydropower is important but so are Wild River

3947
03:44:57,855 --> 03:45:03,999
And we feel that as a people and we feel what a river really can be

3948
03:45:04,255 --> 03:45:06,815
Be a place of magic and mystery and beauty

3949
03:45:08,607 --> 03:45:14,751
And we've made up our mind now that we are going to

3950
03:45:15,007 --> 03:45:17,055
Keep some Rivers Wild

3951
03:45:17,823 --> 03:45:18,591
Both

3952
03:45:18,847 --> 03:45:20,383
What they can give to us

3953
03:45:20,639 --> 03:45:21,663
As a people

3954
03:45:21,919 --> 03:45:28,063
And and also to the animals in the plants that depend upon them and also I think out of some ultimate respect

3955
03:45:28,319 --> 03:45:29,343
Back to the river itself

3956
03:45:34,463 --> 03:45:36,255
Denver now had to look

3957
03:45:36,767 --> 03:45:37,279
Within

3958
03:45:37,535 --> 03:45:41,119
To figure out how to meet it it's water needs without a new source of water

3959
03:45:41,631 --> 03:45:43,935
And what Denver found is that

3960
03:45:44,447 --> 03:45:50,591
A gallon of water saved through conservation and efficiency is just as good as a gallon supplied from a new dam

3961
03:45:50,847 --> 03:45:53,151
In fact it's better because

3962
03:45:53,407 --> 03:45:54,687
It doesn't involve

3963
03:45:54,943 --> 03:45:56,991
Destroying a beautiful place like Cheesman Canyon

3964
03:45:58,271 --> 03:46:02,111
Denver has since been encouraging conservation City

3965
03:46:03,135 --> 03:46:04,159
It turned out that

3966
03:46:04,415 --> 03:46:09,023
Just installing water meters made homeowners more conscious of how much they

3967
03:46:09,279 --> 03:46:11,839
The water board raised water rates

3968
03:46:12,095 --> 03:46:16,191
And now gives cash payments to businesses that adopt efficiency measures

3969
03:46:18,751 --> 03:46:20,031
Program that will pay a business

3970
03:46:20,543 --> 03:46:25,151
A free time what they would pay us for the water if they save that water permanent

3971
03:46:25,919 --> 03:46:28,479
Now it's a one-time payment of up to $20,000

3972
03:46:28,991 --> 03:46:32,319
That business installs water saving Hardware that will save us

3973
03:46:32,575 --> 03:46:34,623
The deal water in the long run we will pay them

3974
03:46:34,879 --> 03:46:40,511
City Ice was one of the first local companies to undergo a water audit

3975
03:46:41,791 --> 03:46:47,935
The biggest item was to try to do something with process water that was coming off our ice making oper

3976
03:46:48,191 --> 03:46:54,335
Reduction in our

3977
03:46:56,895 --> 03:47:02,271
Water from the ice making process was reclaimed for use as a cooling agent in refrigeration

3978
03:47:03,551 --> 03:47:06,367
Many businesses could cut their water use in half

3979
03:47:06,623 --> 03:47:09,951
By reclaiming water for Rin cycles and cooling systems

3980
03:47:12,255 --> 03:47:18,399
One of the best ways homeowners can conserve is to try a landscaping idea pioneer

3981
03:47:18,655 --> 03:47:19,167
Denver

3982
03:47:19,679 --> 03:47:21,471
It's called xeriscape

3983
03:47:21,727 --> 03:47:22,495
And it involves

3984
03:47:22,751 --> 03:47:23,775
Of selecting plant

3985
03:47:24,031 --> 03:47:29,407
Trees and ground cover native to the region or that require only small amounts of water

3986
03:47:29,919 --> 03:47:30,943
Like Buffalo

3987
03:47:33,247 --> 03:47:35,039
Overwatering the lawn is

3988
03:47:35,295 --> 03:47:37,599
Single biggest household waste of water

3989
03:47:39,903 --> 03:47:44,255
We've got to move towards pricing water at somewhere near its value

3990
03:47:44,767 --> 03:47:46,047
We currently give it away

3991
03:47:46,559 --> 03:47:48,095
In fact sometimes we pay people

3992
03:47:49,119 --> 03:47:52,959
What is it's ludicrous that the most fundamental resource that we have

3993
03:47:53,215 --> 03:47:53,983
The one that is

3994
03:47:54,239 --> 03:47:55,263
Fundamental to life

3995
03:47:56,031 --> 03:47:59,359
Is a resource in which we're giving it away

3996
03:47:59,615 --> 03:48:02,943
We waste water in ways that you can't imagine

3997
03:48:03,455 --> 03:48:09,343
Does this completely modernize dishwashing every housewife in the land will answer yes

3998
03:48:09,599 --> 03:48:15,743
The American dream of the 1950s was to have all the modern conveniences

3999
03:48:15,999 --> 03:48:22,143
Washers disposals and dish

4000
03:48:22,399 --> 03:48:28,287
Washers all running on unlimited supplies of water

4001
03:48:32,127 --> 03:48:32,639
Today

4002
03:48:32,895 --> 03:48:38,271
The average American family of four uses 300 gallons of water a day

4003
03:48:39,039 --> 03:48:41,087
Enough to fill this bathtub

4004
03:48:41,343 --> 03:48:42,111
20

4005
03:48:44,927 --> 03:48:46,463
In Tucson Arizona

4006
03:48:46,719 --> 03:48:49,023
At the Casa del Agra or House of water

4007
03:48:49,279 --> 03:48:53,119
A conventional home has been retrofitted with water saving devices

4008
03:48:53,375 --> 03:48:55,935
Is he just how much an average family could

4009
03:48:58,751 --> 03:49:01,823
Glenn and Catherine friends have lived here for 10 years

4010
03:49:02,335 --> 03:49:05,151
Raising their family and monitoring every drop of water

4011
03:49:06,943 --> 03:49:10,783
You're the cost of Delaware house we use about half of what a typical home uses

4012
03:49:11,039 --> 03:49:14,111
That water is portable water that I'm talking about we also use

4013
03:49:14,367 --> 03:49:16,671
Water that is harvested from the roof which is rain water

4014
03:49:16,927 --> 03:49:19,743
Can we use gray water which is the water from the kitchen sinks

4015
03:49:19,999 --> 03:49:22,303
The bathtub the shower and the washing machine

4016
03:49:24,351 --> 03:49:28,703
Fixtures have been equipped with low flow shower heads and faucets

4017
03:49:30,495 --> 03:49:33,567
Recycled gray water and rainwater collected from the roof

4018
03:49:33,823 --> 03:49:36,127
Irrigate the family zeroscape garden

4019
03:49:40,479 --> 03:49:43,551
Studies show that the best way to save water indoors

4020
03:49:43,807 --> 03:49:46,367
Is to replace the old 6 gallon per

4021
03:49:46,623 --> 03:49:49,183
Toilet with a new 1.6 gallon

4022
03:49:49,951 --> 03:49:52,255
Saving 21 gallons per person per day

4023
03:49:53,535 --> 03:49:56,607
Well what is toilets have been used here

4024
03:49:57,119 --> 03:50:01,215
And as a result of the research that we did here on those toilet

4025
03:50:01,727 --> 03:50:05,567
Local plumbing codes have been adopted and now the National Standard has been adopted

4026
03:50:05,823 --> 03:50:08,383
For the use of the 1.6 gallon for flush toilets

4027
03:50:09,407 --> 03:50:15,039
Casa de lagua is just one example of innovative programs around the world that are proving

4028
03:50:15,295 --> 03:50:17,343
Conservation can make a big difference

4029
03:50:18,879 --> 03:50:22,463
But households use only 10% of water worldwide

4030
03:50:23,231 --> 03:50:26,047
And industries claim only 25%

4031
03:50:26,815 --> 03:50:29,119
Agriculture uses the greatest share

4032
03:50:29,631 --> 03:50:31,423
65% worldwide

4033
03:50:32,191 --> 03:50:33,215
And even more

4034
03:50:33,471 --> 03:50:34,495
Here in the Southwest

4035
03:50:35,775 --> 03:50:37,311
Desert Wasteland

4036
03:50:41,407 --> 03:50:42,175
How you

4037
03:50:43,967 --> 03:50:45,247
Imported water

4038
03:51:02,655 --> 03:51:04,703
Today

4039
03:51:05,215 --> 03:51:08,543
California uses more than it's legal share of the Colorado

4040
03:51:09,567 --> 03:51:11,871
Someday it may have to give up that water

4041
03:51:12,639 --> 03:51:13,919
So more and more

4042
03:51:14,175 --> 03:51:16,735
California is looking toward conservation

4043
03:51:18,527 --> 03:51:22,623
Historically we viewed water conservation as something that we do in the middle of a drought

4044
03:51:23,135 --> 03:51:24,671
And once Drive is over we forget about

4045
03:51:25,695 --> 03:51:28,255
It can't be that way anymore water conservation

4046
03:51:28,511 --> 03:51:29,791
You can make a tremendous

4047
03:51:30,559 --> 03:51:35,167
The water system if you will is probably the most inefficient system

4048
03:51:35,423 --> 03:51:36,191
We have

4049
03:51:37,471 --> 03:51:38,239
For any

4050
03:51:40,543 --> 03:51:42,847
In California's Imperial Valley

4051
03:51:43,359 --> 03:51:45,663
Irrigation water from the Colorado River

4052
03:51:45,919 --> 03:51:49,503
Is brought in by canals managed by the Bureau of Reclamation

4053
03:51:50,015 --> 03:51:52,575
And paid for by us taxpayers

4054
03:51:55,135 --> 03:51:57,439
Farming here is a billion dollar business

4055
03:52:01,279 --> 03:52:05,887
All they pay is the cost of delivery

4056
03:52:10,239 --> 03:52:12,031
Dating back to the 19th century

4057
03:52:12,287 --> 03:52:14,847
Water rights in this Valley are tied to the land

4058
03:52:16,895 --> 03:52:18,943
Since water is so cheap

4059
03:52:19,455 --> 03:52:23,039
There has been little incentive to invest in conservation

4060
03:52:25,599 --> 03:52:28,927
The Imperial Irrigation District slurps off about

4061
03:52:29,183 --> 03:52:31,999
20% of it

4062
03:52:32,255 --> 03:52:34,559
To irrigate 400,000 acres of land

4063
03:52:35,583 --> 03:52:37,119
Very permeable land

4064
03:52:38,143 --> 03:52:38,911
Scorching clim

4065
03:52:39,167 --> 03:52:39,679
So

4066
03:52:39,935 --> 03:52:40,959
Very high water to

4067
03:52:42,495 --> 03:52:47,615
A lot of people complained about that for a long time is perhaps the ultimate example of ineffic

4068
03:52:48,895 --> 03:52:53,503
The IID now is beginning to think about selling some of this

4069
03:52:55,039 --> 03:52:56,831
And I personally think that's a good idea

4070
03:52:57,087 --> 03:52:58,879
Los Angeles is really paying

4071
03:52:59,135 --> 03:53:00,671
For the efficiency improvements

4072
03:53:00,927 --> 03:53:02,463
And then paying for the water as well

4073
03:53:03,487 --> 03:53:06,815
Like this pump back system that recaptures surface runoff

4074
03:53:07,583 --> 03:53:10,911
Paid for by the Metropolitan water district of Southern California

4075
03:53:11,423 --> 03:53:14,495
Mwd gets to keep the water saved

4076
03:53:14,751 --> 03:53:16,543
And the farmer gets to keep the system

4077
03:53:17,567 --> 03:53:20,383
And you water marketing deals

4078
03:53:20,639 --> 03:53:23,967
Farmers are beginning to sell their water to cities like San Diego

4079
03:53:24,991 --> 03:53:28,063
It's a good way for thirsty cities to find new supp

4080
03:53:29,599 --> 03:53:31,647
It can create windfall profits

4081
03:53:31,903 --> 03:53:35,999
Or landowner selling water that's been subsidized at taxpayer expense

4082
03:53:37,791 --> 03:53:42,399
The billionaire Bass Brothers of Texas recently bought 30,000 acres here

4083
03:53:42,911 --> 03:53:45,983
And hope to Market some of the water that goes with their land

4084
03:53:46,751 --> 03:53:52,895
We got to stop giving away water as if it was a free good

4085
03:53:53,151 --> 03:53:54,687
You have Farm

4086
03:53:54,943 --> 03:53:57,247
Wasting water and you have millions of people

4087
03:53:58,783 --> 03:54:00,831
I need additional

4088
03:54:02,111 --> 03:54:03,135
Well it doesn't take a gen

4089
03:54:03,391 --> 03:54:03,903
Figure out

4090
03:54:04,159 --> 03:54:05,695
Just going to be in a very short period of time

4091
03:54:09,023 --> 03:54:15,167
Agriculture accounts for the Lion's Share of the world's water and a very large share on the order of 80 to

4092
03:54:15,423 --> 03:54:17,215
5%, and most of the western us

4093
03:54:17,983 --> 03:54:21,311
So this is really the the biggest pool of water that that we have

4094
03:54:21,823 --> 03:54:26,175
Saving even a tiny share of water in agriculture can free up a lot of water

4095
03:54:26,431 --> 03:54:27,711
To meet new Urban

4096
03:54:28,223 --> 03:54:34,367
Cities like Los Angeles are looking for ways to reduce the

4097
03:54:34,623 --> 03:54:39,743
What's the water they use and to reclaim and reuse water before they dispose of it

4098
03:54:42,047 --> 03:54:48,191
The Metropolitan water district works with local groups like mothers of East Los Angeles to encourage

4099
03:54:48,447 --> 03:54:51,007
Low flow toilets

4100
03:54:51,263 --> 03:54:56,895
Started by one of Gutierrez the organization is now run by her daughter Elsa Lopez

4101
03:54:57,663 --> 03:55:01,247
We have given approximately about $85,000 toilet

4102
03:55:01,759 --> 03:55:07,135
And that will be a savings of 7.6 billion gallons of water

4103
03:55:07,391 --> 03:55:07,903
A year

4104
03:55:10,719 --> 03:55:15,839
People bring in their old water guzzling toilets and exchange them for the new low flow models

4105
03:55:16,863 --> 03:55:23,007
Mayabahoya Independence

4106
03:55:24,287 --> 03:55:30,431
And the mothers of East LA get $25 for each old-fashioned toilet they collect

4107
03:55:37,087 --> 03:55:42,719
The freeways the new toilet save the city 8 million gallons a day

4108
03:55:42,975 --> 03:55:49,119
We're really excited about having the water conservation program and the results I have come from it

4109
03:55:49,375 --> 03:55:50,911
Saving all those gallons of water

4110
03:55:51,423 --> 03:55:52,191
And

4111
03:55:52,447 --> 03:55:53,727
Saving the community money

4112
03:55:53,983 --> 03:55:56,031
And bring it in jobs for them

4113
03:55:56,543 --> 03:56:02,687
What the shop up right over here

4114
03:56:02,943 --> 03:56:09,087
Each year Lopez takes teenagers from East LA 300 miles

4115
03:56:09,599 --> 03:56:10,367
Kimono

4116
03:56:11,391 --> 03:56:13,695
So they can see where some of their water comes from

4117
03:56:15,743 --> 03:56:21,375
It's an unusual Mountain Lake rimmed with strange natural structures made of lime

4118
03:56:21,887 --> 03:56:23,423
They're called to the towers

4119
03:56:27,519 --> 03:56:29,055
How does a tufa

4120
03:56:31,615 --> 03:56:33,151
Some of this is always a thousand years

4121
03:56:34,431 --> 03:56:36,991
But a lot of it's really young 75 to 200 years

4122
03:56:37,503 --> 03:56:38,783
And yet it's above ground

4123
03:56:39,039 --> 03:56:40,319
And two for only for

4124
03:56:40,831 --> 03:56:41,343
Underwater

4125
03:56:41,855 --> 03:56:44,159
So you know that the lake has dropped pretty quickly

4126
03:56:51,583 --> 03:56:54,143
The Lakes level had drained down

4127
03:56:54,399 --> 03:56:58,495
Because water from its feeder streams was being diverted to Los Angeles

4128
03:57:00,543 --> 03:57:03,615
But a state water board decision in 1994

4129
03:57:03,871 --> 03:57:05,151
Stops the diversions

4130
03:57:05,663 --> 03:57:08,223
And now it's waters are slowly Rising

4131
03:57:10,271 --> 03:57:16,415
Pour out the movie the excess water system

4132
03:57:16,671 --> 03:57:22,815
I think what we all realize is that there are mono Lakes at the ends of all of our taps or these special places

4133
03:57:24,351 --> 03:57:25,631
Of our water suppl

4134
03:57:28,703 --> 03:57:33,055
Conservation and recycling will become even more important to Los Angeles

4135
03:57:34,335 --> 03:57:36,127
The loss of water from Mono Lake

4136
03:57:36,383 --> 03:57:38,431
Has increased the need to conserve

4137
03:57:39,711 --> 03:57:41,247
The city also knows

4138
03:57:41,503 --> 03:57:46,111
That it will eventually have to give up some of the Colorado River water on which it depends

4139
03:57:46,623 --> 03:57:48,159
Water that belongs to

4140
03:57:48,415 --> 03:57:49,183
Upstream

4141
03:57:52,255 --> 03:57:53,279
And by treaty

4142
03:57:53,791 --> 03:57:57,119
A portion of the Colorado's water belongs to Mexico

4143
03:57:59,423 --> 03:58:01,471
There's a very fundamental problem with the Colorado River

4144
03:58:02,239 --> 03:58:03,519
Or there was a very rainy year

4145
03:58:03,775 --> 03:58:07,103
And then all the politicians sat down to divide up the amount of water

4146
03:58:07,359 --> 03:58:08,127
And they made

4147
03:58:08,383 --> 03:58:09,407
A very large mistake

4148
03:58:09,919 --> 03:58:11,967
They divided up more water than they've ever had since

4149
03:58:12,735 --> 03:58:14,271
It hasn't rained as much and haven't had

4150
03:58:14,527 --> 03:58:15,039
Much water

4151
03:58:15,295 --> 03:58:17,087
Since The Times They divide it up

4152
03:58:17,343 --> 03:58:18,111
So what you have

4153
03:58:19,135 --> 03:58:20,927
You've overallocated that River

4154
03:58:21,439 --> 03:58:22,975
You've given away more water

4155
03:58:23,231 --> 03:58:23,999
Then you really have

4156
03:58:27,071 --> 03:58:33,215
Have been described as thirsty

4157
03:58:33,471 --> 03:58:35,263
Dogs fighting over a damn sponge

4158
03:58:37,567 --> 03:58:43,199
This is one of the few Wetlands remaining in the Colorado Delta

4159
03:58:43,455 --> 03:58:44,991
Just South of the Border

4160
03:58:46,271 --> 03:58:46,783
It gives

4161
03:58:47,039 --> 03:58:51,135
Small idea of what the Delta used to be like before dams

4162
03:58:54,207 --> 03:58:57,791
In 1922

4163
03:58:58,047 --> 03:59:04,191
The Great American conservationist Aldo Leopold pay the visit to the Colorado Delta and wrote

4164
03:59:04,447 --> 03:59:10,591
About it in The Marvelous essay in sand County Almanac is his Masterworks when he found there was

4165
03:59:10,847 --> 03:59:11,871
Price of paradise

4166
03:59:12,127 --> 03:59:12,895
For wildlife

4167
03:59:13,151 --> 03:59:14,175
Jaguar

4168
03:59:14,431 --> 03:59:15,711
Cougars bobcat

4169
03:59:15,967 --> 03:59:17,247
Team with water

4170
03:59:17,759 --> 03:59:20,063
It's so ironic that in that year

4171
03:59:20,319 --> 03:59:22,879
The Colorado River compact the sign and that

4172
03:59:23,135 --> 03:59:25,183
Began shutting off the flow of water

4173
03:59:28,767 --> 03:59:30,047
And it's essentially a dead zone

4174
03:59:30,559 --> 03:59:31,839
Everything that Leopold saw

4175
03:59:32,351 --> 03:59:32,863
Is gone

4176
03:59:33,119 --> 03:59:38,751
Vehicle describe the Colorado Delta

4177
03:59:39,007 --> 03:59:41,055
As a milk and honey wilderness

4178
03:59:41,567 --> 03:59:43,871
Full of 100 green lagoons

4179
03:59:45,407 --> 03:59:51,551
The region provided habitat for species

4180
03:59:51,807 --> 03:59:53,599
Live mostly in zoos today

4181
03:59:54,367 --> 03:59:56,671
Endangered creatures like the jaguarundi

4182
03:59:59,999 --> 04:00:01,535
A Mexican wolf

4183
04:00:03,839 --> 04:00:04,863
Today

4184
04:00:05,119 --> 04:00:06,655
The Colorado Delta

4185
04:00:06,911 --> 04:00:10,751
Has been transformed into miles of dried out salt

4186
04:00:15,615 --> 04:00:17,407
The river no longer makes it to the

4187
04:00:17,663 --> 04:00:18,431
California

4188
04:00:18,687 --> 04:00:20,991
It's historic destination

4189
04:00:22,271 --> 04:00:26,879
Virtually nothing is reaching the delta

4190
04:00:27,391 --> 04:00:30,207
In an average year and so the ecosystem has been

4191
04:00:30,719 --> 04:00:32,511
Completely changed and

4192
04:00:32,767 --> 04:00:33,279
The native

4193
04:00:33,535 --> 04:00:37,631
Communities that have relied on this ecosystem and this water for thousands of years

4194
04:00:37,887 --> 04:00:40,959
Are now suffering and very much in Decline themselves

4195
04:00:42,751 --> 04:00:46,335
Fisheries in this region are in severe trouble

4196
04:00:46,591 --> 04:00:51,711
In part because of overfishing but also because diversions of water Upstream

4197
04:00:51,967 --> 04:00:54,271
Damage the Delta spawning grounds

4198
04:01:07,583 --> 04:01:13,727
The cocoa pot Indians who live in the Delta once had a thriving culture of fishing

4199
04:01:13,983 --> 04:01:16,031
In Riverbank farming

4200
04:01:17,311 --> 04:01:19,359
No matter because

4201
04:01:20,127 --> 04:01:21,151
Their way of life

4202
04:01:21,407 --> 04:01:22,687
Is now in jeopardy

4203
04:01:24,735 --> 04:01:27,039
Weeds choke the river behind their Village

4204
04:01:28,063 --> 04:01:29,855
It's barely a foot deep

4205
04:01:32,927 --> 04:01:34,719
Animated

4206
04:01:39,583 --> 04:01:45,727
Tomorrow for tomorrow I want to make the skeleton do another of this camera customer

4207
04:01:47,007 --> 04:01:50,335
No Palawan radio

4208
04:01:51,359 --> 04:01:54,175
Jose don't leave Animal Hospital

4209
04:01:54,431 --> 04:01:55,455
Bella pesca

4210
04:01:57,503 --> 04:01:58,783
Porque Pacino

4211
04:01:59,039 --> 04:02:01,087
Yeah they already talk almost a

4212
04:02:02,111 --> 04:02:05,183
Practice out for La Cristiano

4213
04:02:05,439 --> 04:02:11,583
Today for their household needs

4214
04:02:11,839 --> 04:02:14,143
Coca power reliant on water brought in by the barrel

4215
04:02:14,655 --> 04:02:20,543
They say bathing is basically

4216
04:02:22,591 --> 04:02:28,735
Has for fishing the cocoa must now haul their boat

4217
04:02:28,991 --> 04:02:35,135
40 miles to get to the saltwater channel of the Gulf of California

4218
04:02:35,391 --> 04:02:41,535
And they bought fuel for both the trucks and the boats it becomes a costly trip

4219
04:02:48,191 --> 04:02:50,495
But it's mainly the young men who go out in the boat

4220
04:02:57,151 --> 04:03:03,295
These Waters were once Rich fishing grounds and fish

4221
04:03:09,951 --> 04:03:15,071
But on this day

4222
04:03:15,327 --> 04:03:21,471
They catch nothing

4223
04:03:21,727 --> 04:03:27,871
Finally after many hours of effort they give up

4224
04:03:28,127 --> 04:03:34,271
It is a very long trip IND

4225
04:03:49,887 --> 04:03:55,007
The community's young people still hold fast to the tribes identity as River people

4226
04:03:56,031 --> 04:03:58,591
Fake chosen the name pescad

4227
04:03:59,103 --> 04:04:01,663
For fisherman for the soccer team

4228
04:04:05,247 --> 04:04:09,087
Dear future is clouded by the problems with the Colorado River

4229
04:04:13,439 --> 04:04:14,975
When are y'all went right now

4230
04:04:16,255 --> 04:04:17,791
You know what I hope

4231
04:04:18,303 --> 04:04:19,839
You everything I don't want nothing

4232
04:04:21,631 --> 04:04:26,495
They Don't Really consumer Rio Colorado

4233
04:04:26,751 --> 04:04:28,287
So I thought I would stop by

4234
04:04:28,543 --> 04:04:31,359
Perhaps

4235
04:04:31,615 --> 04:04:35,199
If the true potential of conservation could be realized

4236
04:04:35,455 --> 04:04:41,343
And the benefits distributed fairly there was some day be enough water for everyone

4237
04:04:42,367 --> 04:04:46,719
To restore the coral River delt

4238
04:04:46,975 --> 04:04:47,743
Will take a lot

4239
04:04:48,255 --> 04:04:51,583
It's probably impossible to go back to what it used to be Los

4240
04:04:51,839 --> 04:04:56,703
A lot of things that can be done with just allowing somebody to come

4241
04:04:57,215 --> 04:04:58,239
Particular times

4242
04:04:58,751 --> 04:04:59,263
Of the year

4243
04:05:01,823 --> 04:05:06,943
A good important lesson is when we look at other Elders we should now carefully

4244
04:05:07,199 --> 04:05:08,479
Look at the environmental impact

4245
04:05:08,735 --> 04:05:14,879
The diamond on irrigation project will have we should not repeat what we did with the

4246
04:05:22,303 --> 04:05:25,631
In the end we may need a new water ethic

4247
04:05:25,887 --> 04:05:28,703
And I think that says it's important now to begin

4248
04:05:28,959 --> 04:05:29,471
Sharing

4249
04:05:29,983 --> 04:05:31,775
With each other as well as with nature

4250
04:05:34,079 --> 04:05:36,127
There's no proverb that goes something like

4251
04:05:36,383 --> 04:05:38,687
The Frog does not drink up the pond

4252
04:05:38,943 --> 04:05:41,247
In which it lives and I think it's a very simple

4253
04:05:41,503 --> 04:05:43,039
Wisdom but it really

4254
04:05:43,295 --> 04:05:45,599
Captures the challenge I think that we're facing which is

4255
04:05:45,855 --> 04:05:48,927
How we're going to meet our growing human needs for water

4256
04:05:49,439 --> 04:05:50,463
And still live in Bal

4257
04:05:50,719 --> 04:05:51,999
With the ecosystems

4258
04:05:52,255 --> 04:05:53,279
That support all life
