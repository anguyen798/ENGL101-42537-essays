1
00:00:01,101 --> 00:00:04,104
( intro music )

2
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:35,235
The last time I came here,

3
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:37,704
I walked 90 miles
across the dry,

4
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:42,575
forgotten river channel.

5
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:46,912
But in the spring of 2014,
something happened.

6
00:00:46,912 --> 00:00:50,816
A river of sand became wet
once again,

7
00:00:50,816 --> 00:00:53,485
and the first time
the Colorado River

8
00:00:53,485 --> 00:00:56,089
kissed the sea
in nearly in two decades.

9
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:59,525
We can bring a river
back to life, if we try.

10
00:00:59,525 --> 00:01:01,961
Male voice over:
River Colorado.

11
00:01:09,635 --> 00:01:13,840
( applause )

12
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,407
Pete McBride: Thank you
very much for coming.

13
00:01:15,407 --> 00:01:17,844
It's a great honor to be here.

14
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:20,179
About 20 years ago,
I had the...

15
00:01:20,179 --> 00:01:22,214
the unusual experience to walk
into the building next door

16
00:01:22,214 --> 00:01:24,584
and try to sell them a story,

17
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:27,487
which ended up
being my first story

18
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:30,089
with National Geographic.

19
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:32,925
It was a story of taking
a biplane

20
00:01:32,925 --> 00:01:34,961
from London to Cape Town
in South Africa.

21
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:37,463
We re-enacted the first
African air-passage.

22
00:01:37,463 --> 00:01:40,066
They did it in 1920,
we did it in 1998.

23
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:42,068
They did it in 43 days
in 1920,

24
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:44,437
we did it in 58 in 1998.

25
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,406
( laughter )

26
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:48,541
But it gave me
a very unusual perspective,

27
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:51,377
not only on African aviation,
but on rivers.

28
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:52,879
I got to fly up
the length of the Nile River,

29
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,513
the longest in the world.

30
00:01:54,513 --> 00:01:56,348
So, I came home and...

31
00:01:56,348 --> 00:01:59,085
and started talking
to my father actually who

32
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:00,386
got me pointed
in this direction,

33
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:02,688
of looking
at the Colorado River.

34
00:02:02,688 --> 00:02:04,957
A river that
I actually grew up on,

35
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,459
but I didn't really know it
that well, to be honest.

36
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,361
I knew that the Grand Canyon
is there in the middle,

37
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:09,596
but I really didn't know
what happens

38
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:11,597
to the end of the river
below the Grand Canyon

39
00:02:11,597 --> 00:02:13,032
and where does the river
actually go,

40
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:14,333
where does it end.

41
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,135
And as a native Coloradan,

42
00:02:16,135 --> 00:02:19,439
who grew up right there,
in the Roaring Fork Valley,

43
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,374
I thought it would be
an interesting story

44
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:23,409
to follow this river.
So, I came back home.

45
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:27,113
I came back to a field
I spent a lot of time in.

46
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:29,282
I'd come every summer
back home

47
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:31,584
and work on the ranch and
move sprinklers like this

48
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:33,252
for flood irrigation systems
and I started wondering

49
00:02:33,252 --> 00:02:35,621
about the water
and where this goes.

50
00:02:35,621 --> 00:02:37,257
And how long
will it take this water

51
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:40,059
to actually go to the sea,
so I followed it.

52
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:42,161
I first started up in the
mountains where I live.

53
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:44,997
This is Pyramid Peak,
14,000 feet.

54
00:02:44,997 --> 00:02:46,465
I have actually
skied this peak,

55
00:02:46,465 --> 00:02:47,767
and I skied it in June

56
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:49,135
when there was
nine feet of snow.

57
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:50,370
I took this photo
on Christmas day

58
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,870
two years ago,

59
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,339
there is three inches of snow.

60
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,474
So, we are facing some
climate change issues

61
00:02:55,474 --> 00:02:56,742
and we are also seeing
some influence

62
00:02:56,742 --> 00:02:58,344
coming in from the west to us.

63
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,246
This is Snowmass Peak,

64
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:02,715
not far from where I live,
also 14,000 feet,

65
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:05,818
and you see that brown tint,
that's actually dust

66
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:07,587
that's been blown in
from the west

67
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,621
because of more development
basically through

68
00:03:09,621 --> 00:03:11,724
road constructions,
some oil and gas.

69
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:14,259
And what happens is it creates
a trans-evaporation process

70
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:16,328
where the particles in the...

71
00:03:16,328 --> 00:03:18,764
of the dust actually
retain the sun's heat

72
00:03:18,764 --> 00:03:20,967
and melt the snow up faster.

73
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:23,135
So, we are losing a runoff
at a much faster rate,

74
00:03:23,135 --> 00:03:24,737
They say
we're losing the river,

75
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,238
about 5% of the river

76
00:03:26,238 --> 00:03:28,941
due to this trans-evaporation
process.

77
00:03:28,941 --> 00:03:31,844
And the Colorado
is not the largest

78
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:33,346
or the longest river
in the US.

79
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,514
It is actually seventh.

80
00:03:35,514 --> 00:03:36,649
But many would argue

81
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:39,084
that it's the most loved
and litigated.

82
00:03:39,084 --> 00:03:40,920
This is near Kremmling,
Colorado

83
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,288
and if you look
at the top of the frame

84
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:43,755
that's looking due east,

85
00:03:43,755 --> 00:03:46,326
I'm looking
at the Continental Divide,

86
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,561
you look what appears to be
a healthy river,

87
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,830
but in fact, this river is
actually flowing at about

88
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,266
50% of its
traditional capacity.

89
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,968
There are 22 trans-basin
diversion projects,

90
00:03:55,968 --> 00:03:57,736
basically tunnels
that you can't see

91
00:03:57,736 --> 00:03:59,405
that are going underneath

92
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,906
the Continental Divide,
in the top of the frame,

93
00:04:00,906 --> 00:04:02,541
and taking water to
Denver, Boulder,

94
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,943
Fort Collins,
Colorado Springs...

95
00:04:04,943 --> 00:04:06,345
Now what's interesting
about this is

96
00:04:06,345 --> 00:04:07,880
that water goes over there,
that's great,

97
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,882
they need the water,
but that water never returns

98
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:11,484
to the Colorado River basins.
So we are taking water

99
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,186
that would end up
in the Pacific,

100
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:14,988
and we are taking
and putting it in the Atlantic.

101
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:18,190
So, we are seeing changes
right out at the gates.

102
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,326
They did a study
on the Colorado River

103
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:22,495
and just the value it
brings from recreation.

104
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:24,897
They've came back
with a staggering figure,

105
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:28,100
that is $ 26 billion
that this river produces,

106
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,636
in revenue through fishing,
rafting, picnicking,

107
00:04:30,636 --> 00:04:32,471
any form of recreation
on the length of the river

108
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:35,074
that runs 1500 miles.

109
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:36,942
If you put that
on the Forbes 500 list,

110
00:04:36,942 --> 00:04:38,444
it would be ahead of
Progressive Insurance

111
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,912
and US Airways.

112
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:42,849
So, a river with water in it
has value.

113
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:46,419
Most of that water goes
towards agriculture.

114
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:49,555
So, I focused a lot
on the aerial perspective,

115
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:51,090
in part, because I think
it gives us

116
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,692
a perspective of
where we've been

117
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:54,627
and where we are going
with our landscape,

118
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,530
but also because I had this
crazy guy on the right,

119
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,132
who I could hire at a rather
affordable price, my father.

120
00:05:00,132 --> 00:05:01,466
( laughter )

121
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,235
So, as we follow this river,

122
00:05:03,235 --> 00:05:05,604
we are going to come
into Utah,

123
00:05:05,604 --> 00:05:07,239
beautiful landscape
and you can see

124
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:08,908
how this river is
sculpting through it.

125
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:12,445
This Castle Valley. And
if you get on the ground,

126
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:17,250
in Canyonlands National
Park area, Mesa Arch.

127
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,418
A remarkable landscape
that's been shaped with

128
00:05:19,418 --> 00:05:21,353
the uplift
of the Colorado plateau and

129
00:05:21,353 --> 00:05:23,622
the Colorado River of course,
helping carve it out

130
00:05:23,622 --> 00:05:26,492
and create this
magnificent architecture.

131
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,127
You could do
about a 90 degree turn,

132
00:05:29,127 --> 00:05:30,896
go over another ridge and
you would look over on this.

133
00:05:30,896 --> 00:05:33,299
It is a potash mine.

134
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:34,800
We actually need potash
for fertilizer.

135
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,202
I have nothing
against potash

136
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,271
but this image I used
to represent industry,

137
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:39,972
because industry is becoming
a large straw

138
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,641
on Colorado River.

139
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:43,875
Potash may not be
that terrible,

140
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:46,378
but oil and gas recently
has been picking up

141
00:05:46,378 --> 00:05:48,181
significantly
in this part of the world.

142
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,682
There was recently
a water auction

143
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,283
for... during drought

144
00:05:51,283 --> 00:05:53,385
and all the farmers went
to the water auction to see

145
00:05:53,385 --> 00:05:55,120
if they can get more water
through this drought year.

146
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,156
And they were outbid
on every single count

147
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:58,991
by oil and gas companies.

148
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:00,726
And one oil and
gas well can use

149
00:06:00,726 --> 00:06:03,229
one to five million
gallons of water.

150
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:05,831
Just downstream is one
of my favorite images.

151
00:06:05,831 --> 00:06:07,366
I took this with my father.

152
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:08,800
We had to actually break
into the airport

153
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,470
because to get here
at sunrise,

154
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,372
the airport opened
at sunrise,

155
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:15,775
so I had to crawl over the
fence and let him in.

156
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:18,644
But this is a double oxbow
naturally occurring,

157
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:20,613
and just downstream there,
you come into, what I call

158
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:23,015
the seas of the desert'.

159
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:25,617
This is Lake Powell,
the change is dramatic

160
00:06:25,617 --> 00:06:27,853
the ecology of this river.

161
00:06:27,853 --> 00:06:29,621
They say that it receives

162
00:06:29,621 --> 00:06:32,424
up to 1400
cargo ship containers a day

163
00:06:32,424 --> 00:06:34,660
of silt and sediment,
that's basically the memory

164
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,628
of the Colorado Rockies
falling down

165
00:06:36,628 --> 00:06:39,298
and it gets deposited
in this reservoir

166
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:42,234
which affects the fish
and ecology downstream.

167
00:06:42,234 --> 00:06:45,170
And we are quickly finding out
how much sediment is in there

168
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,907
and what's happening because
the lake is dropping rapidly.

169
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,376
We are in our second decade
of drought

170
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:53,479
and that white line
is the bathtub ring

171
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:55,948
on Lake Powell.
It's about 75 feet.

172
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:59,084
Lake Powell is now
at 51% capacity.

173
00:06:59,084 --> 00:07:00,252
If you go there right now,

174
00:07:00,252 --> 00:07:02,522
it's dropping
one to six inches a day.

175
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:06,625
And that's the dam,
Glen Canyon dam.

176
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:09,161
It produces
a 120 million dollars in revenue

177
00:07:09,161 --> 00:07:10,729
through its
hydroelectric program.

178
00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:12,097
It goes back to
Federal programs

179
00:07:12,097 --> 00:07:13,699
for transmission lines
and actually

180
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:16,269
native fish species programs
downstream.

181
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,070
We are getting to
such a point of

182
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,540
drought and
water shortage that

183
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,475
we are approaching
what is called 'Dead Pool'

184
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,877
when there isn't enough water
to go over through

185
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:27,079
the turbines
and spin those turbines.

186
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:30,983
Now just below that dam,
starts the Grand Canyon.

187
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:35,021
It is 277 miles of one of
the most enchanted places

188
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,522
on the planet
that I've seen.

189
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:37,690
It's like going to
another world of

190
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,992
geology and magic.

191
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:41,894
Of course,
it is not real anymore

192
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:43,529
to some degree because
this river fluctuates

193
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:45,798
through the habits
and needs of man

194
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,267
as we have
hydroelectric demands with

195
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,303
air conditioning
and what not.

196
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,071
It's called...

197
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,639
as a whole the Grand Canyon
is called as

198
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,041
'America's Roofless
Cathedral'.

199
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:58,944
There is a proposal out there
right now

200
00:07:58,944 --> 00:08:02,381
to build a 1.4 mile long
tramway,

201
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:05,784
it will descend 1300 feet
and carry 4000 people a day

202
00:08:05,784 --> 00:08:07,819
into the Grand Canyon.

203
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:11,156
Now, those of the people that
don't like to hike or boat,

204
00:08:11,156 --> 00:08:13,559
may think that's great.

205
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:16,896
However, it is also a sacred
confluence right there.

206
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:18,998
Believed to be sacred
by the Hopi and the Zuni

207
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,766
and some of the Navajo,

208
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,968
so it is creating
a big controversy

209
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:24,670
and we are going to see
that play out

210
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,971
in the next few years.

211
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:27,907
This is the
humpback chub.

212
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:29,308
They've basically been
swimming in this river

213
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:31,010
for 6000 years.

214
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,278
And now there is only
about 6000 of them left,

215
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:35,580
because they like warm water
and once we put that dam

216
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,882
and of course
it is the cold water

217
00:08:36,882 --> 00:08:38,784
coming up through the dam,
so they've retreated

218
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:41,119
to this little confluence,
it's milky color

219
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:44,090
because of its
high calcium content.

220
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,158
There's four species of
endangered fish left,

221
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:47,960
two have already
gone extinct.

222
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,763
This is Nankoweap Point.

223
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:53,532
And those are the granaries
of the Puebloans

224
00:08:53,532 --> 00:08:56,235
that have been there
since 1100 A.D.

225
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:58,704
And so many
of the Native Americans

226
00:08:58,704 --> 00:08:59,939
who live around
the Grand Canyon,

227
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,440
there are actually 11 tribes
that surround

228
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,442
the Grand Canyon
National Park,

229
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:05,143
and they believe
that this is

230
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:06,945
where they came from
and where they go.

231
00:09:06,945 --> 00:09:09,214
This is their spirit world.

232
00:09:09,214 --> 00:09:10,716
And just to give you
a little idea behind

233
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,218
capturing
some of these images,

234
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,887
I conceived this image
about five years ago,

235
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,389
when I went down there on
another trip,

236
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,891
but you have to...
first you have to get a permit

237
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,293
to get down there.
You get that,

238
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,761
then you go down
on the river trip,

239
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,596
then you have to secure
a camp site near the spot

240
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,130
because
you can't reserve those,

241
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,732
it's 'first come first serve'.

242
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,600
Then you have to hopefully
time your permit lines up

243
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,869
with the full moon,
then you have to go up

244
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:31,970
with some,
some high powered spotlights

245
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,639
because you can't go up
to the Granary,

246
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:36,175
so you've got to shine them
on a very specific tripod.

247
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:38,443
And hope it all lines up
and boom!

248
00:09:38,443 --> 00:09:41,146
That's what sometimes
one image can take.

249
00:09:41,146 --> 00:09:45,417
Now, we may go through
whooping and hollering

250
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:47,219
as tourists
in the Grand Canyon, but

251
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:49,255
there are many people
who take it very seriously.

252
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,991
This is a Havasupai elder
who has come down.

253
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,726
I happened to go down there
this last spring

254
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,294
and it just
coincided with

255
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:58,664
the Hopi, Zuni, Navajo and
Hualapai spiritual trips.

256
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:00,465
That's partially funded by
that money coming upstream

257
00:10:00,465 --> 00:10:02,367
from the Glen Canyon dam.

258
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,470
So, this is a big deal
and of course, I asked him,

259
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,038
'What do you think about
all these people hooting and

260
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:07,840
hollering and having parties
in the Grand Canyon?'

261
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,941
He says, 'Well, there's
nothing I can do about it,

262
00:10:09,941 --> 00:10:12,344
but I just hope
you respect it.'

263
00:10:12,344 --> 00:10:14,980
In 1903, President Roosevelt

264
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,616
came to the South Rim
of this Canyon.

265
00:10:17,616 --> 00:10:19,384
It's on the right side,
you can see the South Rim

266
00:10:19,384 --> 00:10:20,919
and in the very right corner
up there

267
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:22,922
and he says,
'Leave it as it is.

268
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:24,957
The ages have been
at work on this

269
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,125
and man can only mar it.'

270
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,793
And I think we've done
a pretty good job,

271
00:10:28,793 --> 00:10:31,363
but the threats are
definitely looming

272
00:10:31,363 --> 00:10:32,798
in the distance to mar it.

273
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,267
There's new development
that wants to be built up

274
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:37,202
all around the Grand Canyon,
there's water challenges,

275
00:10:37,202 --> 00:10:38,637
there's this tramway.

276
00:10:38,637 --> 00:10:40,872
Uranium mines have been trying
to get in there for a while,

277
00:10:40,872 --> 00:10:43,408
they've been fended off
for about 20 years.

278
00:10:43,408 --> 00:10:45,344
But it's something
that's not going to go away

279
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:47,779
anytime soon if we don't keep
a close eye on it.

280
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:49,448
The river on the other hand,

281
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:51,082
we may have not done
the best job

282
00:10:51,082 --> 00:10:52,918
of maintaining it
through the Canyon.

283
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:55,087
Now the water color here
is emerald green,

284
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:56,855
it looks beautiful,
but it is not very natural,

285
00:10:56,855 --> 00:10:58,791
and it just represents
how we have changed

286
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,792
the dynamic of this river
and of course that

287
00:11:00,792 --> 00:11:04,530
clear waters eroding a lot
of natural sand and sediment.

288
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,132
Now, this is one of
the most storied rapids,

289
00:11:07,132 --> 00:11:09,635
this is called the V-wave,
if you can get through here

290
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:11,403
and not lose your oars,
you're in great shape.

291
00:11:11,403 --> 00:11:14,339
I went through it with my
brother in these boats

292
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:16,509
that some boatmen described
as being built of

293
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,343
papier-mâché and
baby bird bones.

294
00:11:18,343 --> 00:11:20,045
( laughter )

295
00:11:20,045 --> 00:11:22,481
This is the 'oh crap' face
of here we go

296
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:24,016
into the V-wave,
I'm on the left,

297
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,818
my brother on the right,

298
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:28,320
he's got more of
an 'oh crap' face.

299
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,890
This is 'Oh God, we've just...
plan A has just gone sideways,

300
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,592
because
we've just lost an oar,

301
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:35,427
we're going to plan B'.

302
00:11:35,427 --> 00:11:37,997
This is
'Oh we are going to die'

303
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,598
because we are going into
the big kahuna wave now

304
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:40,999
with no oars.

305
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:43,935
We're taking this little tiny
flimsy wooden boat,

306
00:11:43,935 --> 00:11:45,337
through the middle
of this giant rapid

307
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:46,838
and we realize
we're about to flip.

308
00:11:46,838 --> 00:11:49,942
So... we thought we were dead.

309
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,910
But we made it somehow.
( laughter )

310
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,379
Of course
we smiled at the end.

311
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,813
It was the first time
I got to show my brother

312
00:11:54,813 --> 00:11:56,215
the Grand Canyon,

313
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,050
it was a highlight for me
because

314
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,385
this river on some levels,

315
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,487
there's an expression
called, 'river capture'.

316
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:04,857
where one watershed
will basically

317
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,858
out-erode another one
and capture its water

318
00:12:06,858 --> 00:12:08,493
and take it with you.

319
00:12:08,493 --> 00:12:10,262
And essentially
what has happened to me is

320
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:12,264
I feel like the Colorado River
on some level

321
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:15,134
has captured my curiosity
and part of my soul,

322
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,735
so I keep going back,
so it was a real treat

323
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:18,336
to share with my brother.

324
00:12:18,336 --> 00:12:21,273
When you leave
the Grand Canyon you come

325
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:24,009
to Lake Mead, Hoover dam.
You've all heard of this

326
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:25,778
remarkable piece of
engineering

327
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:27,379
that they built in 1935,

328
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:29,915
it used to be the largest dam
in the world.

329
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:33,953
And just like upstream, but
even worse at this point,

330
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:38,890
Lake Mead is now at its
all-time record low, 39%.

331
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:41,761
Las Vegas,
which sits next to Lake Mead

332
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,862
and myself included
when I started this project,

333
00:12:43,862 --> 00:12:45,597
many of us point to Las Vegas,

334
00:12:45,597 --> 00:12:48,200
the oasis dream,
the big problem.

335
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,236
Their water intake is so close
to the water level now,

336
00:12:51,236 --> 00:12:52,805
Lake Mead, that they are
actually spending

337
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:55,240
a billion dollars to construct
the third straw.

338
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,978
They are basically building
a bathtub drain,

339
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:01,580
from under here, all the way
back over to Vegas.

340
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,114
Because if the water level
gets any closer

341
00:13:03,114 --> 00:13:05,317
to their intake valve, by law

342
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,686
they might not be able to
use it.

343
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:08,821
So, we are fearing

344
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:11,490
some very significant changes
in infrastructure.

345
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:14,993
Vegas at the same time,

346
00:13:14,993 --> 00:13:18,029
which is very interesting
to me when I learned this,

347
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:20,266
they wrote a law of the river
in 1922

348
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:23,068
which basically divvied up
the Colorado River into

349
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:27,106
seven states, they cut it up
into different pies,

350
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:30,208
and nobody... Vegas didn't
really exist in 1922,

351
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:33,311
so nobody expected there to be
this booming oasis dream.

352
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,913
So, they didn't give them
very much water.

353
00:13:34,913 --> 00:13:37,983
So, Vegas is now forced to
use their water very wisely.

354
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,885
They recycle a lot of their
fountains and pools,

355
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:41,453
they do mandatory
pool coverings,

356
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:43,555
a lot of fountains are
grey water,

357
00:13:43,555 --> 00:13:45,090
they've been taking

358
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,060
the smart-scaping,
zero-scaping to another level.

359
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,095
They realized 70%
of their water

360
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:51,963
from the Colorado river is
going to people's front lawns,

361
00:13:51,963 --> 00:13:53,298
so they started a program

362
00:13:53,298 --> 00:13:55,066
where they actually pay people

363
00:13:55,066 --> 00:13:57,402
$ 2 a square foot,
and it is now a $ 1.50,

364
00:13:57,402 --> 00:13:59,605
to tear out their
front lawn.

365
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,773
I took that first picture
at 8 in the morning.

366
00:14:01,773 --> 00:14:04,042
I took that picture same day
at 11.

367
00:14:04,042 --> 00:14:06,578
Crew came in,
ripped out the lawn,

368
00:14:06,578 --> 00:14:08,313
gave the guy a check,
and adios!

369
00:14:08,313 --> 00:14:10,815
( laughter )

370
00:14:10,815 --> 00:14:13,352
And the hope of course,
is that the oasis dream

371
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,188
that many of us may love
and enjoy

372
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,490
will be able to continue
on some level but also

373
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,926
the oasis dream for
critters like this,

374
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:22,494
the Rocky Mountain toad,

375
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:24,095
that had a love affair
with my camera

376
00:14:24,095 --> 00:14:26,164
when I was looking for
humpback chub,

377
00:14:26,164 --> 00:14:30,202
wouldn't leave me alone,
they'll have water too.

378
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:34,440
The Gila River downstream,
this was taken in 1936.

379
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,743
One of the last tributaries
of the Colorado.

380
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:38,810
That's today.

381
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,546
That was taken
by my friend Jon Waterman,

382
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:44,316
who paddled the length
of the Colorado River.

383
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:47,018
And then we come back down
into Yuma, Arizona,

384
00:14:47,018 --> 00:14:48,486
right before
the Colorado River crosses

385
00:14:48,486 --> 00:14:50,823
over the
US-Mexican border.

386
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:53,224
A massive amount of
lettuce production here,

387
00:14:53,224 --> 00:14:55,260
agriculture throughout
the region, and so

388
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,095
if you are sitting there
saying,

389
00:14:57,095 --> 00:14:58,930
'This is interesting, Pete,
Colorado river is beautiful

390
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,666
maybe I'll go raft it one day.

391
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,467
But I mean, come on,
I've got plenty of water here

392
00:15:02,467 --> 00:15:05,537
in Washington D.C.,
why does this concern me?'

393
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:07,405
It actually concerns all of us
on some level

394
00:15:07,405 --> 00:15:09,141
because every piece of lettuce

395
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:10,375
that you buy
in the grocery store

396
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,976
in the months of
December and January

397
00:15:11,976 --> 00:15:13,779
come from the Colorado River.

398
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:15,980
That's the only place
that supplies the nation.

399
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,317
It's basically
the nation's salad bowl

400
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:19,918
comes from
this part of the world.

401
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:21,453
So, we all eat
the Colorado River

402
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,855
whether you are
aware of it or not.

403
00:15:23,855 --> 00:15:26,491
I grew up on a cattle ranch,

404
00:15:26,491 --> 00:15:29,494
I'm not opposed
to the production of beef,

405
00:15:29,494 --> 00:15:31,130
if it is done wisely.

406
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,431
I don't know if this is
the wisest method...

407
00:15:33,431 --> 00:15:35,334
having feedlots
in the Imperial Valley

408
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,603
where it's 128 degrees.

409
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,904
So I think
we need to start moving

410
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:40,105
towards smart agriculture.

411
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,140
There are also some
antiquated laws

412
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,875
where if you don't use
your water, you will lose it.

413
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,610
So, there are farmers
in this area that are growing

414
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,579
five-six cuttings of alfalfa

415
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:50,048
and actually shipping it
to Asia,

416
00:15:50,048 --> 00:15:51,517
because they don't want to
lose their water

417
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:52,985
even though
they don't need the money.

418
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,319
So, in some ways
we are actually

419
00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:55,621
exporting some of our water

420
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,223
in the form of
alfalfa to Asia.

421
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:00,291
And then you come after...

422
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,194
to the last major dam
of the river.

423
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:03,562
There are 12 major dams
on the river.

424
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,097
This is the Morelos dam.

425
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:07,866
This is U.S-Mexican border,
for 22 miles

426
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:10,969
the river becomes the border
and runs due south.

427
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:13,071
And if you go below the dam,

428
00:16:13,071 --> 00:16:16,040
which I did with Jon
when he was paddling,

429
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,942
just two miles into Mexico,

430
00:16:17,942 --> 00:16:20,679
you come to the end
of the river.

431
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,314
Ben Franklin said,

432
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:25,216
'We learn the value of water
when the well runs dry'.

433
00:16:25,216 --> 00:16:27,186
This is the well running dry.

434
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:30,756
This is what it looked like
when I was paddling through.

435
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:34,393
Jon Waterman:
What is this stuff?

436
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:35,861
Pete McBride: All I know is
I'm not that excited

437
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:38,663
to get into this water.

438
00:16:38,663 --> 00:16:40,599
Jon Waterman:
So this is what's become

439
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:42,568
of the mighty Colorado?

440
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:43,869
Pete McBride: Yeah.

441
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:46,538
So, we packed
up our boats..

442
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:50,108
90 miles shy of the sea
and started walking.

443
00:16:50,108 --> 00:16:51,643
There were many times
where I wondered

444
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:53,745
why the hell I was carrying
a boat on my back.

445
00:16:53,745 --> 00:16:56,648
( laughter )

446
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:58,217
Pete McBride: The Colorado
River has run to the Sea

447
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:00,953
of Cortez for 6 million years,
not a single drop

448
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:04,623
of it has run naturally
to the sea since 1998.

449
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:06,091
It was one of the largest

450
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:07,760
desert estuaries
in North America.

451
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:09,194
This is the western
flank of it

452
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,429
over on the Baja side.

453
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:14,466
3000 square miles, jaguars,
Cottonwood forests,

454
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:17,368
it took me two days
to find this image.

455
00:17:17,368 --> 00:17:22,074
That's what
we've changed it to.

456
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:24,976
Some people say, 'Well,
who cares about the delta,

457
00:17:24,976 --> 00:17:27,513
you know, who... why should we
put water down there?'

458
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:31,316
But I... can pretty much
guarantee this guy cares.

459
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:33,952
20,000 Cocopah Indians
used to live in the delta.

460
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:37,088
This was their
traditional fishing grounds.

461
00:17:37,088 --> 00:17:38,556
This guy learned to fish here.

462
00:17:38,556 --> 00:17:40,658
It's dried up in his lifetime.

463
00:17:40,658 --> 00:17:42,427
And I'm pretty sure
if this happened to my river

464
00:17:42,427 --> 00:17:45,697
in my backyard, I'd probably
feel similar, feel frustrated.

465
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:48,100
Just to give you an idea
where that is exactly,

466
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,034
this little red circle,

467
00:17:50,034 --> 00:17:51,837
it's in the center,
that's the delta.

468
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,805
That little frappuccino pit
I was paddling,

469
00:17:53,805 --> 00:17:56,875
it is on the middle
bottom-third of that circle.

470
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,876
So, I think if these rivers
often as arteries,

471
00:17:58,876 --> 00:18:00,879
they help connect communities,

472
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:03,147
they actually help
connect wildlife.

473
00:18:03,147 --> 00:18:04,683
They support our agriculture.

474
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:07,185
They keep salinity
in our water table at bay.

475
00:18:07,185 --> 00:18:08,620
Potentially you know,

476
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,456
they connect our human spirit
on some level.

477
00:18:11,456 --> 00:18:15,994
So, I think the Colorado
today is

478
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:18,396
a very powerful metaphor
on so many levels

479
00:18:18,396 --> 00:18:19,864
because it shows us

480
00:18:19,864 --> 00:18:21,366
what happens
when we ask too much

481
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:24,069
of a limited resource,
it disappears.

482
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:27,005
I ended here in the delta.

483
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:29,707
This last spring there was
an experimental pulse flow,

484
00:18:29,707 --> 00:18:31,910
thanks to the hard work of
very, very many

485
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,145
from a vast
group of people

486
00:18:34,145 --> 00:18:40,852
and this is what
became of the river.

487
00:18:40,852 --> 00:18:44,155
This was actually less than
1% of the river's annual flow.

488
00:18:44,155 --> 00:18:45,757
It was Mexico's water,

489
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:48,493
it was part of a new
agreement called 'Minute 319'.

490
00:18:48,493 --> 00:18:50,362
Very interesting because, uh,

491
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:52,363
Mexico basically had
an earthquake

492
00:18:52,363 --> 00:18:54,132
that fractured
its irrigation system.

493
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:57,435
They said, 'We need some help.
We can't store water anywhere.

494
00:18:57,435 --> 00:18:59,571
It is time to work together
for a change'.

495
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:01,740
So, they went to the U.S.

496
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,443
And this is two miles in

497
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:07,278
This about where that
frappuccino pit was.

498
00:19:07,278 --> 00:19:08,880
Beautiful scene of people
coming out

499
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,983
from all over Mexico.

500
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,617
Not only restoring
the vegetation,

501
00:19:12,617 --> 00:19:14,753
but the spirit of the river.

502
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:15,887
Anyway, Mexico said

503
00:19:15,887 --> 00:19:17,288
'We need help'
and U.S said 'Alright'.

504
00:19:17,288 --> 00:19:18,856
So, they came back
to the table and said

505
00:19:18,856 --> 00:19:20,759
'Alright, We are going
to renegotiate Mexico's water,

506
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:23,094
they do get an allocation,
but now they are gonna

507
00:19:23,094 --> 00:19:25,496
make sure that
Mexico's allocation is

508
00:19:25,496 --> 00:19:27,799
shares in surplus
and shortage

509
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:30,068
and that they will dedicate
some water to the delta.

510
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:31,970
So, this was that water
dedicated.

511
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:34,038
It was released for
eight weeks to see how it did

512
00:19:34,038 --> 00:19:36,941
to try to spawn
some of the seedlings,

513
00:19:36,941 --> 00:19:41,780
cottonwoods, and willows,
and it was pretty remarkable.

514
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,982
We took paddle boards
and canoes

515
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:45,817
all the way across it.

516
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:47,986
In 1922, Aldo Leopold

517
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:50,221
took a canoe across the delta
and he wrote,

518
00:19:50,221 --> 00:19:52,190
'The river was nowhere
and everywhere',

519
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,593
for he could not--
for he could not decide

520
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:58,229
which of a hundred green
lagoons to take to the sea.

521
00:19:58,229 --> 00:19:59,931
Beautiful line that I've used

522
00:19:59,931 --> 00:20:01,899
over and over at water talks
about the Colorado River,

523
00:20:01,899 --> 00:20:03,868
and I never ever thought that

524
00:20:03,868 --> 00:20:05,770
I would actually see this
and paddle

525
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,239
across a green lagoon
in the delta.

526
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:08,807
So, it is very encouraging
to see

527
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:10,876
that we can make a change.

528
00:20:14,412 --> 00:20:18,216
( music )

529
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:19,718
Male 1: We gonna have to go
over that.

530
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,286
Pete McBride: Not good.

531
00:20:22,787 --> 00:20:26,491
This is an improvement.
I swear.

532
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:28,993
You're moving.

533
00:20:28,993 --> 00:20:31,295
( speaking in Spanish )

534
00:20:31,295 --> 00:20:35,500
This is called moving an inch...
an hour.

535
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,836
Bushwhacking this terrain

536
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:39,805
in a trickle of water
with the paddleboard

537
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:43,374
is an upgrade. Trust me.

538
00:20:43,374 --> 00:20:45,944
What are we doing here?

539
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:48,346
The last time
I came here,

540
00:20:48,346 --> 00:20:50,782
I walked 90 miles
across the dry,

541
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:53,218
forgotten river channel.

542
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:56,721
My backyard river,
the Colorado...

543
00:20:56,721 --> 00:21:00,425
I have been chasing its flow
for years.

544
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,462
Most people think of it
as that loved

545
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:05,363
architect of the
Grand Canyon,

546
00:21:05,363 --> 00:21:08,032
carrying the memory
of the Rocky Mountains

547
00:21:08,032 --> 00:21:11,303
near my home in Colorado.

548
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:13,972
But it is different down here
at the end,

549
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:16,341
where severe plumbing
on this southwest lifeline

550
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:18,209
have sucked it dry,

551
00:21:18,209 --> 00:21:21,046
so we can eat baby spinach
in January.

552
00:21:23,848 --> 00:21:28,119
But in the spring of 2014,
something happened.

553
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:30,288
Two countries decided
to work together

554
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:32,124
to restore a delta.

555
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,658
The hands of many
lifted the gates

556
00:21:33,658 --> 00:21:35,627
on the Morelos Dam

557
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,628
and released a temporary
pulse of water.

558
00:21:37,628 --> 00:21:39,931
Less than 1%
of the river's flow.

559
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:41,933
Mexico's allocated agua

560
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:44,168
into the delta
to see what happened.

561
00:21:44,168 --> 00:21:48,072
A river of sand became wet
once again.

562
00:21:48,072 --> 00:21:50,775
And a fiesta ignited
down downstream.

563
00:21:50,775 --> 00:21:54,146
( music )

564
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,786
Locals celebrated
the return of their Rio.

565
00:22:01,786 --> 00:22:05,123
( music )

566
00:22:11,629 --> 00:22:16,000
The native species
exploded with seeds.

567
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,937
The river party only lasted
a few weeks though.

568
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:22,006
( music )

569
00:22:22,006 --> 00:22:25,409
Partake? We did what
any river lover would do.

570
00:22:25,409 --> 00:22:30,549
We floated it,
by canoe, paddleboard,

571
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:33,051
and eventually slogged it
by foot,

572
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:34,686
crossing the shallows.

573
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,220
I believe
this is the Colorado,

574
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,089
it is hard to tell
because generally

575
00:22:38,089 --> 00:22:40,792
the Rio Colorado had no water.

576
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:43,561
But as you can see,

577
00:22:43,561 --> 00:22:47,999
it is a pretty frigging
nice river right now.

578
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:49,701
Male 2: It looks amazing.

579
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,903
Usually,
this part of the river

580
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:54,472
is completely dry,
it's sand always,

581
00:22:54,472 --> 00:22:56,941
and it has been many years
like that.

582
00:22:56,941 --> 00:22:59,044
Now on May 7th,

583
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:03,414
after nine 13-hour long
paddling days...

584
00:23:03,414 --> 00:23:04,949
Male 3: I'm so tired,
I can barely stand.

585
00:23:04,949 --> 00:23:06,618
We crossed 90 miles
of the delta

586
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:08,253
and reached the sea.

587
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:10,288
It was the first and
only paddleboard crossing

588
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:12,423
of the new delta.

589
00:23:12,423 --> 00:23:14,258
And the first time
the Colorado River

590
00:23:14,258 --> 00:23:17,729
kissed the sea
in nearly two decades.

591
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,798
On many levels it was
a preposterous journey,

592
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:23,401
foolish, or even
wrong headed...

593
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:26,170
I don't feel like
I'm getting anywhere.

594
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:29,341
It was also beautiful
and symbolic.

595
00:23:31,008 --> 00:23:33,044
That with a relative trickle,

596
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:35,379
we can bring a river
back to life...

597
00:23:35,379 --> 00:23:37,215
if we try.

598
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:40,718
( applause )

599
00:23:40,718 --> 00:23:44,389
( outro music )
